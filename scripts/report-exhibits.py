"""Generate the M4 report exhibits from named git objects (D-0064 / D-0067 / D-0071 / D-0072 / D-0079 / D-0081).

The harness overwrites `results/runs.csv` and `results/phases.csv` per
run; they are not an append-only history. Baseline columns therefore
come from tag `baseline-t4.3` via `git show`, after-ladder / Δ
columns from the T4.6 superpage CSV commit, D-0068 dump-placement
from its two CSV commits, the T4.8 cross-system table from that
campaign's CSV commit (frozen as the pre-FTRACE before; D-0073
does not retarget it), the Linux decomposition from the T4.8
serial pin (`d705ecb`), and D-0072 hole labels from the
`ignore_loglevel` pin (`93ab617`). HEAD may hold a later batch;
pins do not follow it. The T4.8b table comes from its own CSV pin
(`t48b`, D-0073 after) with T4.8 frozen as the before. The T4.8c
table comes from `t48c` (D-0081) with T4.8b frozen as the before.
The T4.7 firmware exhibit comes from the t47c CSV pin (`c2759e2`).
`cross-system-current.md` is an alias for whichever campaign
CURRENT_COMPARISON names: the report's prose cites it wherever it
means "the comparison"; per-campaign exhibits stay frozen.
The working-tree files are not read — a local `just bench` leftover
cannot become an exhibit.

Never type the numbers this script prints.
`just report-exhibits` regenerates report/exhibits/.
Failing-input selftest: `just report-exhibits-selftest` (does not write exhibits).
