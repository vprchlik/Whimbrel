# DECISIONS — Architecture Decision Log

Every nontrivial choice gets an entry here **before** the code that implements
it ("nontrivial" = a reviewer could reasonably ask "why not X?"). This log is
the raw material for the report's design section.

## Entry format

```
## D-NNNN: <short imperative title>
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD    Status: accepted | superseded by D-MMMM
- Decision: what we will do, one or two sentences.
- Alternatives considered: each with the reason it lost.
- Rationale: why the winner won — argued from project goals
  (legibility, defensibility, scope) and hardware behavior, not fashion.
- Consequences: what this commits us to, what it costs, when to revisit.
```

Entries D-0001 through D-0010 record the project's fixed constraints (locked
at kickoff; do not revisit unless the user explicitly reopens them).
D-0011 onward are working decisions made under those constraints.

---

## D-0001: Write the kernel in Rust with `no_std`
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** the kernel and app are Rust, `#![no_std]` `#![no_main]`, with
  `core` + `alloc` only; unsafe code is allowed but localized and commented.
- **Alternatives considered:** C (the systems lingua franca; rejected: memory
  bugs cost debugging sessions we'd rather spend on OS concepts). C++ (rejected: freestanding
  C++ brings runtime edge cases — exceptions, guards, ABI — without Rust's
  safety payoff). Zig (rejected: attractive for bare-metal but a smaller
  ecosystem and weaker story for the grad-school writeup than Rust's growing
  OS-research presence).
- **Rationale:** Rust gives compile-time memory/aliasing guarantees in the 95%
  of the kernel that doesn't need `unsafe`, a first-class cross-compilation
  story (`riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf` is a rustup-distributed target), and
  `no_std` + `GlobalAlloc` is a clean teaching seam between "language" and "OS
  responsibilities".
- **Consequences:** we own a panic handler, allocator, and entry glue; some
  assembly is unavoidable (entry, trap frame, context switch). No `std`
  conveniences anywhere, ever.

## D-0002: Target rv64gc exactly
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** ISA is RV64GC (= IMAFDC + Zicsr/Zifencei) via the
  `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf` target.
- **Alternatives considered:** RV32 (rejected: 64-bit matches Sv39 and every
  serious RISC-V OS target; RV32 saves nothing here). RV64IMAC without F/D
  (rejected: avoids FPU-state questions but deviates from the rustup target
  and from what OpenSBI/QEMU default to; not worth a custom target JSON).
- **Rationale:** rv64gc is what QEMU `virt` emulates by default, what the
  prebuilt Rust target ships for, and what real hardware (and Linux distros)
  standardize on — every spec citation and comparison stays apples-to-apples.
- **Consequences:** F/D state exists; until a decision says otherwise, kernel
  and app avoid FP so we can defer FPU context switching (record a decision at
  M2 if that changes).

## D-0003: QEMU `virt` machine with OpenSBI via `-bios default`, single platform
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** the only supported platform is `qemu-system-riscv64 -machine
  virt` booting the bundled OpenSBI (`-bios default`); the kernel is entered in
  S-mode at 0x8020_0000 with `a0`=hartid, `a1`=DTB.
- **Alternatives considered:** writing our own M-mode stub (rejected: educational
  but a milestone's worth of PMP/delegation/counter setup before the first
  print — wrong scope). RustSBI (rejected: same interface as OpenSBI, smaller
  deployment base; nothing learned that OpenSBI doesn't teach). Real hardware
  (rejected: board bring-up variance would eat the schedule; QEMU gives
  determinism and free instrumentation — `-d int`, GDB stub).
- **Rationale:** staying in S-mode above stable firmware is exactly the
  position a real OS occupies; the SBI boundary is small, documented, and
  answers what firmware does for the kernel.
- **Consequences:** anything M-mode (PMP, `medeleg`, mtime programming) is
  OpenSBI's job — we interact via `ecall` only. QEMU version gets pinned in
  the M4 report for reproducibility.

## D-0004: Console I/O goes through the SBI console, no raw UART driver
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** all kernel console output uses the SBI Debug Console
  extension (DBCN), specifically `console_write_byte` (see D-0015). We do
  not write an NS16550A driver unless a later milestone is blocked without
  one.
- **Alternatives considered:** raw NS16550A MMIO driver at 0x1000_0000
  (rejected for now: a fine exercise but duplicates what firmware already does;
  adds an MMIO mapping dependency into M0 that Sv39 work in M1 would then have
  to preserve).
- **Rationale:** minimal-and-legible: one `ecall` wrapper is ten lines and
  works before paging, after paging, and inside trap handlers. The UART itself
  still gets exercised — OpenSBI drives it — satisfying the "UART hello"
  acceptance.
- **Consequences:** console output traps to M-mode on every call (slow — fine
  for a debug console; note it in the M4 report if it shows up in
  measurements). Revisit only if M3 needs interrupt-driven console input.

## D-0005: Sv39 paging
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** virtual memory uses Sv39 (three-level, 39-bit VA, 4 KiB pages),
  enabled from M1 onward.
- **Alternatives considered:** Bare mode / no paging (rejected: forfeits W^X,
  fault isolation for U-mode, and the paging work the rest of the kernel sits
  on). Sv48/Sv57 (rejected: a fourth/fifth level buys address space we
  will never use — 512 GiB is already ~4000× our RAM — and costs one more level
  of walk complexity in every diagram and debugging session).
- **Rationale:** Sv39 is the smallest paging mode every rv64 implementation
  must support and the default assumption of RISC-V OS literature; three levels
  is exactly enough to teach multi-level translation.
- **Consequences:** all mapping code, diagrams, and the report assume 3 levels;
  `satp.MODE=8` hardcoded with a citation.

## D-0006: Single address space, kernel identity-mapped
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** one root page table for the lifetime of the system; kernel
  identity-mapped (VA = PA) with W^X permissions; the app lives in the same
  address space, isolated by the U bit and permission bits, not by separate
  tables.
- **Alternatives considered:** per-task address spaces with `satp` switching
  (rejected: it's the defining feature of a *process* abstraction, which a
  unikernel deliberately discards; would add ASID/TLB churn and copy-in/out
  machinery for zero benefit with one app). Higher-half kernel mapping
  (rejected: classic and useful for real OSes, but with a single address space
  it adds an offset-translation layer to every debugging session for no
  isolation gain here).
- **Rationale:** the unikernel thesis *is* "one app, one address space, cheap
  syscalls" — this decision is the project's identity, and M4 measures its
  payoff against Linux.
- **Consequences:** a buggy app can be stopped by permission bits but tasks
  can't be isolated from each other (fine: M3 has exactly one). U-mode pages
  need the U bit; kernel access to them will require `sstatus.SUM` handling —
  to be recorded in M2 detailing.

## D-0007: Single hart, no SMP
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** the kernel runs on hart 0 only; QEMU launched with `-smp 1`
  semantics (default); secondary harts, IPIs, and locking-for-parallelism are
  out of scope.
- **Alternatives considered:** SMP bring-up via SBI HSM (rejected: doubles the
  complexity of every subsystem — per-hart stacks, real spinlocks, memory-
  ordering audits — while the unikernel story needs none of it).
- **Rationale:** concurrency in this project comes from interrupts, not
  parallelism; that's teachable with interrupt-disable critical sections,
  which we can implement and *fully explain*. SMP correctness is a project of
  its own.
- **Consequences:** "locks" are interrupt-disabling guards; any `static mut` /
  interior-mutability pattern must still be justified against interrupt
  reentrancy in a decision or comment. The M4 comparison runs Linux with 1 CPU
  for fairness.

## D-0008: Device scope is UART + virtio-net, nothing else
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** the only devices the kernel knows exist are the console UART
  (via SBI, per D-0004) and one virtio-net-device on virtio-mmio.
- **Alternatives considered:** virtio-blk (rejected: pointless without a
  filesystem, see D-0009). RTC/GPU/rng/9p (rejected: no milestone needs them).
- **Rationale:** the demo workload (HTTP responder) needs exactly a NIC and a
  console; every additional driver is surface area that competes with the
  writeup for time.
- **Consequences:** the driver layer can be honest-to-goodness simple — no
  device model, no bus abstraction; the virtio-mmio probe in M3 hardcodes the
  QEMU `virt` slot range with a citation.

## D-0009: No filesystem, no dynamic loading, no POSIX compatibility
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** no block storage, no VFS, no ELF loader (the app is linked into
  the image at build time), and the syscall interface is our own 5 calls — not
  a POSIX subset.
- **Alternatives considered:** initramfs-style bundled read-only FS (rejected:
  the app is compiled in; there is nothing to load). Runtime ELF loading
  (rejected: it *is* interesting, but it reintroduces the process abstraction
  the unikernel premise removes). Newlib/POSIX shim (rejected: hundreds of
  stub syscalls to pretend to be Unix, which drowns the actual interface
  design lesson).
- **Rationale:** each rejected feature is a fine project by itself; including
  any of them breaks the 1–3-month solo scope and blurs the unikernel claim
  that M4 needs to measure.
- **Consequences:** the app's only environment is the 5 syscalls; "files"
  don't exist (console is `write`, time is `gettime`); the build system, not
  a loader, binds app to kernel.

## D-0010: One app in-image, running in U-mode over 5 syscalls
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint)
- **Decision:** exactly one application, compiled into the kernel image,
  running as the sole U-mode task over `write`, `exit`, `sbrk`, `gettime`,
  `yield`.
- **Alternatives considered:** single-privilege unikernel — app and kernel all
  in S-mode, syscalls are function calls (rejected, and this is the
  interesting one: it's what MirageOS/Unikraft-style unikernels typically do
  and it's *faster*; we deliberately keep the U/S boundary because (a) building
  privilege transition + trap-based syscalls is a core learning goal, and (b)
  it gives M4 a measurable syscall cost to compare against Linux — a
  function-call "syscall" would make that comparison vacuous). Multiple apps
  (rejected: reintroduces scheduling/isolation policy questions unikernels
  exist to avoid; M2 uses 2+ *kernel-defined* tasks only to prove the
  scheduler, then M3 collapses to one app).
- **Rationale:** goals 1 and 2 both need the U/S machinery to exist and be
  measured; the "unikernel" claim stays honest because the *deployment unit*
  is still a single-purpose image.
- **Consequences:** M4 must report syscall latency as trap-based and may
  discuss the forgone function-call design as future work; the 5-call
  interface is a hard wall — any app need not expressible in it becomes a
  decision entry, not a sixth syscall added casually.

---

## D-0011: Clean exit via SBI system reset (SRST), not the sifive-test device
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: superseded by D-0017
- **Decision:** `shutdown()` calls the SBI SRST extension (EID 0x53525354,
  type=shutdown); QEMU exits with code 0.
- **Superseded because:** T0.5 re-opened the choice with the T1.5 mapping cost
  and the harness's pass/fail/hang needs made explicit. D-0017 is the
  decision as implemented.

## D-0012: Hardcode the QEMU `virt` memory map; do not parse the DTB
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** RAM base/size (0x8000_0000 + 128 MiB), UART, PLIC, and
  virtio-mmio addresses are named constants with citations to the QEMU source
  (`hw/riscv/virt.c`); we standardize on QEMU's default RAM size and the
  `justfile` never passes `-m`. The DTB pointer in `a1` is printed at boot but
  not parsed.
- **Alternatives considered:** minimal DTB parse for `/memory` and
  `timebase-frequency` (rejected for now: a flattened-device-tree parser is
  real surface area — strings block, struct walking, endianness — serving
  exactly one platform we already know by heart; D-0003 fixed that platform).
- **Rationale:** minimal-and-legible; the constants are auditable against one
  file of QEMU source; a wrong constant fails loudly and immediately.
- **Consequences:** changing QEMU's `-m` silently breaks the frame allocator's
  idea of RAM end — mitigated by an M1 boot assertion probing that the DTB
  pointer (which QEMU places near end of RAM) is consistent with the constant.
  Revisit only if the project ever targets a second platform (it won't).

## D-0013: Hand-roll the frame allocator and heap allocator; no allocator crates
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** M1 implements a free-list physical frame allocator and a
  linked-list heap allocator behind `GlobalAlloc`, written in-tree.
- **Alternatives considered:** `linked_list_allocator` / `buddy_system_allocator`
  crates (rejected: they're good code, but "I depended on a crate" explains
  nothing about how allocation works here; our allocation patterns are tame,
  fragmentation sophistication buys us nothing).
- **Rationale:** the allocators are small (≈60–150 lines each), high-yield
  teaching artifacts, and the fail-loudly policy (panic on exhaustion with the
  requested size) keeps them honest.
- **Consequences:** we accept worse fragmentation behavior than a buddy
  allocator; if a real workload ever fragments the heap, that becomes a
  documented finding (interesting!) rather than a hidden crate swap.

## D-0014: Minimal and legible beats clever — the tiebreaker rule
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (fixed constraint, meta)
- **Decision:** when two designs both satisfy a milestone, choose the one that
  is shorter to explain from hardware behavior up, even at measured cost in
  performance or generality. Cleverness must buy a milestone requirement or it
  loses.
- **Alternatives considered:** performance-first (rejected: M4 measures, but
  the project's product is *understanding* + a defensible writeup, not
  throughput). Generality-first / "build it like a real OS" (rejected: every
  abstraction layer added "for later" is unfalsifiable scope creep; D-0009
  exists for the same reason).
- **Rationale:** both stated goals (understanding the system end to end, a
  research writeup) reward a system whose every line has a reason the author
  can articulate.
- **Consequences:** this entry is the citation for future "why didn't you..."
  questions; deviations from it require their own decision entry.

## D-0015: Console bytes go through DBCN `console_write_byte` (FID 2)
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** kernel console output uses the SBI Debug Console extension
  (EID `0x4442434E` `"DBCN"`), function `console_write_byte` (FID 2). One
  `ecall` per byte. Probe DBCN via BASE `sbi_probe_extension` (EID `0x10`,
  FID 3) before the first write; if it is absent, abort (no legacy fallback).
- **Alternatives considered:** legacy `sbi_console_putchar` (EID `0x01`, no
  FID — rejected: deprecated, and it does not teach the `a7`/`a6` convention
  SRST and TIME will use). DBCN `console_write` (FID 0, a whole buffer from a
  physical address — deferred: same `Write::write_str` shape wants bytes, and
  buffer-write is an optimization if console volume ever shows in M4 numbers).
  Raw NS16550A MMIO (rejected in D-0004).
- **Rationale:** DBCN is the current spec and the interface that survives;
  FID 2 is the same shape as `core::fmt::Write` and ~10 lines; the calling
  convention is the one every later SBI call will use.
- **Consequences:** every printed byte traps to M-mode and back (slow; fine
  for a debug console). A missing DBCN is a hard abort, not a silent fallback
  to EID `0x01`. Revisit FID 0 only if M4 measurements blame console `ecall`
  volume.

## D-0016: Unmapped guard page below the boot stack (M1/T1.5)
- Date: 2026-08-12 — Status: accepted (implement at M1/T1.5, not before)
- **Decision:** once Sv39 is live, leave one 4 KiB page immediately below
  `__boot_stack_bottom` unmapped so a stack overflow takes a store page fault
  instead of silently corrupting whatever sits there.
- **Alternatives considered:** keep the stack adjacent to `.bss` with no gap
  (status quo until paging exists — there is no translation, so an unmapped
  page cannot fault). A mapped guard with no W bit is equivalent on this
  hardware; unmapped is simpler (no PTE to get wrong).
- **Rationale:** today `__boot_stack_bottom` sits exactly at `__bss_end`.
  Overflow walks downward into `.bss` (and then into `.data` / `.rodata` /
  `.text`) with no trap. That is undetectable until some static is impossibly
  wrong. Paging is the first moment the hardware can tell us.
- **Consequences:** do **not** implement this in M0. The linker hole lands in
  M1/T1.5 and the mapping in M1/T1.6; the frame allocator must not hand that
  page out. Revisit the linker script then if the gap needs a named symbol.

## D-0017: Shut down via SBI SRST; harness parses serial, not exit codes
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted (supersedes D-0011)
- **Decision:** `shutdown()` probes and calls the SBI System Reset extension
  (EID `0x53525354` `"SRST"`, FID 0, type=shutdown, reason=none). We accept
  that this yields **no guest-controlled exit code**: QEMU exits 0 on
  shutdown. Pass vs fail vs hang is distinguished by the test harness
  parsing serial (`M0 BOOT OK` / `PANIC` / timeout), not by `echo $?`.
- **Alternatives considered:** sifive_test MMIO at `0x0010_0000` (store
  `0x5555` = exit 0, `(code << 16) | 0x3333` = exit `code` — rejected as
  primary: QEMU-`virt`-only, and T1.5 would have to identity-map that page
  W at the exact moment paging is already the project's hardest step). Keep
  it in the debugging toolbox for contexts where SBI is unreachable.
- **Rationale:** SRST is the firmware interface that survives onto real
  hardware and needs no extra Sv39 mapping. The extra exit-code channel
  buys nothing the harness does not already get from serial + timeout.
- **Consequences:** a panic that parks looks like a hang to `timeout` unless
  serial is grepped for `PANIC` **first** — `just test` does that. Verdicts:
  marker + QEMU exit 0 → `TEST PASS` (exit 0); `PANIC` in serial →
  `TEST FAIL` (exit 1, panic line echoed); timeout without panic →
  `TEST HANG` (exit 2). A failed SRST call prints a reason and parks
  (HANG, with that line). Revisit sifive_test only if a later harness
  truly cannot parse serial.

## D-0018: Arm timers through the SBI TIME extension, not Sstc `stimecmp`
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** M1 arms the timer with the SBI TIME extension
  (EID `0x54494D45` `"TIME"`, FID 0, `sbi_set_timer(absolute_deadline)`),
  probed via BASE exactly like DBCN and SRST. The arm lives in **one
  function** so that M4 can add an Sstc variant behind a build flag as a
  one-site change and report both numbers.
- **Alternatives considered:** writing `mtimecmp` in the CLINT directly
  (impossible, not merely discouraged: OpenSBI's PMP prints
  `Region00: 0x02000000-0x0200ffff M: (I,R,W) S/U: ()`, so the store raises an
  access fault, and access faults are not delegated — our handler would never
  see it). Sstc's `stimecmp` CSR (one `csrw`, no trap, and what Linux uses on
  this platform — rejected for M1: it cannot be probed from S-mode. `misa` and
  `menvcfg.STCE` are M-mode-only, a write to an unimplemented or disabled CSR
  raises illegal instruction, and code 2 is **not delegated**, so we cannot
  catch our own probe failing. The boot banner's `sstc` line is a log message,
  not a runtime API, and the only programmatic source is the device tree,
  which D-0012 declines to parse). Implementing both with runtime selection
  (rejected: needs the same unavailable probe, and doubles the code path in
  the milestone whose purpose is learning traps).
- **Rationale:** the deciding asymmetry is observability, not cost. At a 10 ms
  tick the firmware round trip is on the order of 0.01% of a core, and even a
  1 ms M2 timeslice leaves it under 0.2% — anyone calling SBI TIME "too slow"
  here is arguing from intuition rather than a number. What differs is failure
  behavior: a missing TIME extension is a probe returning zero, which we print
  and abort on in the same idiom as DBCN and SRST; a missing Sstc is an
  illegal-instruction trap that OpenSBI absorbs into a dump we did not write
  and cannot annotate. Committing to an unprobeable capability during the
  milestone about handling traps correctly is backwards.
- **Consequences:** every arm costs an `ecall` round trip through M-mode. The
  M4 report must either match the Linux baseline's mechanism or treat the
  difference as a measured quantity — we choose the latter, which is strictly
  more informative ("we measured the cost of the firmware round trip on our
  own kernel" is a finding, whereas silently matching Linux is only a
  control). `sip.STIP` is not write-clearable from S-mode under either
  mechanism: re-arming is the acknowledgement.

## D-0019: Map all of RAM R+W once; keep the intrusive frame free list
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted (amended by D-0065: virgin frames
  are a bump pointer; the intrusive list holds recycled frames only)
- **Decision:** the kernel address space identity-maps all of RAM except
  OpenSBI's region and the D-0016 guard page: `.text` R+X, `.rodata` R,
  everything else R+W, A+D set on every leaf. Recycled free frames store
  the next-free pointer in the frame's first 8 bytes (D-0019's original
  list). After D-0065, virgin frames are a bump pointer; `.bss` metadata
  is bump, head, recycled count, and total — not a 31k-node list.
- **Alternatives considered:** mapping only allocated frames, with a bitmap
  instead of an intrusive list (rejected: it reintroduces a genuine recursion
  — mapping a page requires allocating a table frame, which requires mapping
  it, which may require allocating another table frame — and it adds a map
  call to every allocation path). Pairing map-on-demand *with* the intrusive
  free list (rejected as incoherent: the list lives inside the memory it
  manages, so traversing it dereferences unmapped frames; if you want
  map-on-demand you must take the 4 KiB bitmap with it).
- **Rationale:** the isolation that map-on-demand buys is isolation of the
  kernel from itself, and with a single address space and one application
  (D-0006, D-0010) there is no second principal to protect against. What we
  get in exchange is that the hardest step in the milestone — activating
  paging — happens over a map with no ordering dependencies inside it, and
  page-table frames are addressable the moment they are allocated. D-0014
  points the same way.
- **Consequences:** a stray kernel pointer into an unallocated frame succeeds
  silently instead of faulting; the guard page is the one deliberate
  exception, and W^X still holds for text and rodata. Page tables live in the
  R+W region they describe, which is self-referential but harmless — we are
  not defending against a malicious kernel.

## D-0020: Register-indexed `TrapFrame` on the kernel stack, `stvec` Direct
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** `#[repr(C)] struct TrapFrame { x: [usize; 32], sepc: usize,
  sstatus: usize }` — all 31 GPRs (`x0` is hardwired zero and never saved,
  its slot stays unused) plus `sepc` and `sstatus`, at offsets `8 * regnum`,
  272 bytes total (already 16-byte aligned as the ABI requires). The frame is
  built on the current kernel stack. `stvec` is set in **Direct** mode. Named
  accessors wrap the array for the registers we discuss by name (`a0`–`a7`
  are `x10`–`x17`). `x2` holds the *pre-trap* `sp`, computed with one extra
  `addi`, so fault reports show the stack pointer at the moment of the fault.
- **Alternatives considered:** named struct fields (`ra`, `sp`, `t0`, `a0`, …
  — reads better in Rust, but desynchronizes silently the first time someone
  reorders the struct without editing the assembly offsets; register-indexed
  offsets are derivable from the register name, so drift is not expressible).
  Saving only the caller-saved set (rejected: whether that is sufficient
  depends on whether we arrived by interrupt or by a call-like exception, and
  getting that reasoning wrong produces corruption that surfaces far from the
  trap; 31 stores cost nanoseconds). Vectored `stvec` (rejected: spreads
  dispatch across a table of entry points that M2's rework would then have to
  touch individually).
- **Rationale:** the hardware saves `sepc`, `scause`, `stval`, and two
  `sstatus` bits, and nothing else — all 31 GPRs still hold the interrupted
  code's values, so preserving them is entirely ours, which is why entry and
  exit are assembly. `sepc` and `sstatus` are saved despite being CSRs
  because a trap taken *inside* the handler (an unknown-cause panic that
  itself page-faults) overwrites them.
- **M2-proofing constraints — these are constraints on M2's design session,
  not suggestions:**
  1. **Entry is four separable blocks:** establish the kernel stack pointer,
     save the frame, call Rust, restore and return. In M1 the first block is
     *empty with a comment saying so*; in M2 it becomes the `sscratch` swap
     (`csrrw sp, sscratch, sp`) and nothing else in the entry changes.
  2. **`sstatus` is saved in the frame** partly so M2 can read `SPP` to learn
     whether the trap came from U-mode or S-mode.
  3. **Instruction-width decoding takes the instruction bits as an argument**,
     never dereferencing `sepc` internally (see D-0021 for why).
  4. **`sscratch` is left meaningless in M1.** M2 decides whether it holds the
     kernel stack pointer or the current task's frame pointer, and that
     depends on a task-control-block design that does not exist yet.
- **Consequences:** `stvec`'s target must be 4-byte aligned or the low two
  bits silently become a mode field. The handler never enables interrupts
  inside itself — hardware already cleared `sstatus.SIE` on entry and we do
  not set it, so there is exactly one trap level in M1.

## D-0021: Advance `sepc` by decoded instruction width, never on interrupts
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** for exceptions we resume *past*, the handler adds the trapped
  instruction's width, decoded from the low two bits of the instruction
  halfword (`0b11` ⇒ 4 bytes, otherwise 2). The decode helper **takes the
  instruction bits as an argument**; the read stays at the call site, where
  the address space is known. For interrupts, `sepc` is never modified. In M2
  the `ecall` path uses the constant 4 with a comment citing that `ecall` has
  no compressed encoding, so the syscall path never reads user memory at all.
- **Alternatives considered:** always `sepc += 4` (rejected: correct for
  `ecall` and `ebreak`, wrong for any compressed instruction — OpenSBI can
  hardcode 4 after an S-mode `ecall` precisely because that instruction has
  no RVC form, and copying the shortcut to a general handler skips a byte and
  lands a later `sret` mid-instruction). A helper that dereferences `sepc`
  itself (rejected: in M2 `sepc` on an `ecall` trap is a *user* virtual
  address, and an S-mode load from a U=1 page faults unless `sstatus.SUM` is
  set — that design inherits either a fault or a hidden SUM dependency in the
  syscall hot path).
- **Rationale:** `sepc` points *at* the faulting instruction for exceptions,
  so returning without advancing re-executes it forever; for interrupts it
  points at an instruction that has not run yet, so advancing skips it
  silently until the consequence is inexplicable. Two rules, one CSR.
- **Consequences:** the width decode is exercised in M1 only by the `ebreak`
  continue-past test, which is enough to prove it; M2's syscall path
  deliberately avoids needing it.

## D-0022: Clear `sstatus.SIE` across the `satp` switch
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** T1.7 clears `sstatus.SIE`, writes `satp`, executes
  `sfence.vma`, then restores the previous `SIE`.
- **Alternatives considered:** reordering M1 so paging (T1.7) precedes timer
  interrupts (T1.3) (rejected: traps and timers are the natural teaching
  order, and the frame allocator that paging depends on wants the trap handler
  working first). Leaving interrupts enabled and trusting the window to be
  short (rejected: it is exactly the window in which an unvalidated mapping
  would be exercised, and the failure is the silent trap loop).
- **Rationale:** ticks have been arriving every 10 ms since T1.3. A timer
  interrupt taken between the `csrw satp` and the `sfence.vma` vectors through
  `stvec` under a translation regime we have not yet validated — precondition
  12 of prerequisite concept 11. Three lines of CSR manipulation remove an
  entire class of nondeterministic hang.
- **Consequences:** a tick can be missed across the switch, which is
  irrelevant to any M1 acceptance criterion. Any future code that changes the
  active address space inherits the same requirement.

## D-0023: Hardcode RAM end, validate the DTB header, treat the DTB as clobberable
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted (refines D-0012; D-0065: init no
  longer writes next-pointers through the blob — clobber is at alloc)
- **Decision:** `RAM_END = 0x8800_0000` stays a named constant (D-0012). At
  boot, before the frame allocator is initialized, read two big-endian `u32`s
  from the DTB pointer in `a1`: the magic (`0xd00dfeed`) and `totalsize`. If
  the magic is wrong, or `a1 + totalsize` falls outside the assumed RAM
  window, panic printing both values. The DTB region is then **explicitly
  clobberable** — it sits at `0x87e0_0000`, inside the range handed to the
  frame allocator, and we never parse it.
- **Alternatives considered:** the heuristic D-0012 originally suggested,
  "the DTB pointer looks like it is near the top of RAM" (rejected: that is a
  coincidence of QEMU's loader, not a guarantee, so it can pass while being
  meaningless). A real `/memory` parse (rejected: 150–250 lines of
  structure-block walking, strings block, big-endian decoding, and
  `#address-cells` handling, to buy portability D-0003 already declined).
  Probing memory by touching it (rejected, and the reason is instructive:
  with paging off and PMP's catch-all region permitting everything, a load
  above RAM end on QEMU `virt` hits unassigned space, which logs a
  `guest_errors` line and returns zero rather than faulting — a probe that
  cannot fail cannot find the boundary).
- **Rationale:** ten lines of header check catch the realistic failure (`-m`
  changed, or `a1` is not what we think) without a parser, and they fail
  loudly with the numbers needed to diagnose.
- **Consequences:** **ordering constraint** — the sanity check must run before
  allocator init, because afterwards the blob may be handed out as frames and
  the check would read heap (D-0065: not at init — at alloc, if the bump
  reaches those PAs). Written here so that nobody in M3 wonders why the
  device tree turned into allocated memory. The `justfile` must continue never
  passing `-m`.

## D-0024: Reserve a fixed 1 MiB heap region before building the free list
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the heap is a fixed 1 MiB region carved immediately above
  `__kernel_end`, reserved *before* the frame free list is built, so the free
  list simply starts above it. The heap is mapped R+W like the rest of RAM
  (D-0019); the `GlobalAlloc` implementation manages blocks inside it.
- **Alternatives considered:** popping 256 frames from the allocator at init
  (rejected: contiguity would depend on the order the free list happened to be
  built in — a correctness property resting on an allocator implementation
  detail). A `static` array in `.bss` (rejected: inflates the image's `.bss`
  and hides the heap from the physical-memory accounting we want to report).
  Growing the heap on demand (rejected: `sbrk` in M2 is the app's break, not
  the kernel heap's; a fixed kernel heap is one fewer moving part).
- **Rationale:** carving first makes both regions trivially non-overlapping by
  construction, and 1 MiB is far more than M1's `Box`/`Vec`/`String` self-test
  or M2's task structures need, while leaving ~125 MiB of frames.
- **Consequences:** heap exhaustion panics rather than growing (there is no
  OOM recovery story in a unikernel). If M3's network buffers want more, the
  constant changes and the decision gets an amendment.

## D-0025: Map no MMIO in M1
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted (amends the pre-M0 T1.5 plan text)
- **Decision:** the M1 kernel address space maps no device memory at all — no
  UART page, no virtio-mmio range, no sifive_test.
- **Alternatives considered:** mapping the UART and the virtio slots "for
  later", as the original pre-M0 plan text said (rejected: we never touch the
  UART because D-0004 routes the console through SBI, and virtio belongs to
  M3; mapping devices we do not use contradicts the standing rule against
  implementing beyond the current milestone, and every unused mapping is a
  window a stray pointer can hit without faulting).
- **Rationale:** the console is an `ecall`, which needs no virtual address,
  and OpenSBI's region stays unmapped deliberately so a stray access there is
  a page fault we decode rather than an access fault firmware absorbs. M3 adds
  the virtio pages in the same task that adds the driver, where the
  permissions can be justified against the code that uses them.
- **Consequences:** the sifive_test escape hatch that D-0017 keeps in the
  debugging toolbox is unusable after paging is on until someone maps that
  page by hand; the supported emergency exit post-T1.7 is SBI SRST, which is
  an `ecall` and needs no mapping. Note this in DEBUGGING.md if it ever comes
  up in practice.

## D-0026: Map every region with 4 KiB leaves; no superpages
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: superseded for the RAM interior by D-0059
  (landed 2026-08-17); 4 KiB remains mandatory everywhere the map
  distinguishes at 4 KiB grain; 1 GiB leaves still rejected
- **Decision:** the M1 kernel address space is built entirely from 4 KiB
  (level-0) leaves. No 2 MiB or 1 GiB superpage leaves.
- **Alternatives considered:** 1 GiB leaves for the RAM window (rejected: a
  1 GiB page at `0x8000_0000` would cover OpenSBI, the guard hole, and every
  W^X boundary in one PTE — the permissions in the PLAN memory-map table
  cannot be expressed). 2 MiB leaves for the aligned interior of
  `[__heap_end, RAM_END)` with 4 KiB leaves everywhere else (rejected: it is
  a second mapping path whose failure mode is concept 11.4 — a non-leaf with
  any of R/W/X set *is* a superpage, and a misaligned PPN on that leaf
  faults). `__heap_end` is not 2 MiB-aligned (`0x8031_8000` after T1.5), so
  the mixed path is mandatory if superpages are used at all, not optional.
- **Rationale:** kernel W^X and the 4 KiB guard already force 4 KiB
  granularity across the image. One leaf size means one walk, one verifier,
  and one PPN-shift. ~32k identity maps at boot are cheap next to that.
  D-0014.
- **Consequences:** the software walker in T1.6 panics if a translation
  resolves at level 1 or 2. Revisit only if a later milestone has a real
  reason to map a huge contiguous R+W region at a coarser grain — and then
  only with an explicit alignment check on the leaf PPN.

  **Supersession (D-0059, landed):** `[0x80400000, RAM_END)` is 2 MiB L1
  leaves with an aligned-PPN panic in both the mapper and the walker.
  The 1 GiB rejection stands. This entry remains the record of why M1
  was 4 KiB-only and of the misaligned-superpage failure mode.

## D-0027: Address-sorted heap free list, coalesce on free, first-fit
- Date: 2026-08-13 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the kernel heap is a first-fit free list of variable-size
  blocks over `[__heap_start, __heap_end)`, kept sorted by address.
  `dealloc` coalesces with the previous and next block when they are
  adjacent. The block header sits immediately before the aligned user
  pointer. Prefix bytes needed to satisfy `Layout::align` are split back
  into the free list when they are large enough to hold a header; otherwise
  they are absorbed into the allocated block (recorded as pad, recovered on
  free). Exhaustion panics with the requested size and alignment; `alloc`
  never returns null.
- **Alternatives considered:** no coalescing (rejected: Vec growth frees
  each previous buffer next to the last one, and without a merge those
  holes cannot satisfy the next doubling — the 1 MiB tail would hide it
  until a later workload). Best-fit (rejected: more walk, same M1
  workload). A bitmap or buddy over the same 1 MiB (rejected: D-0013 /
  D-0014 — the linked list is the thing we have to defend). Returning
  null from `GlobalAlloc` and relying on `handle_alloc_error` (rejected:
  the panic message would not include size and align).
- **Rationale:** an address-sorted list makes adjacency a pointer
  comparison at insert time, so coalescing is the cheap correctness
  property rather than an extra pass. First-fit plus coalesce is the K&R
  allocator.
- **Consequences:** a stream of mixed-size alloc/free that never produces
  adjacent holes can still fragment until a request fails with free bytes
  remaining. M1's self-test does not hit that; if M2/M3 does, it is a
  finding, not a silent crate swap.

## D-0028: Trap handlers must not allocate
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted (constraint on M2's design session)
- **Decision:** neither the heap nor the frame allocator may be entered
  from a trap handler. That is an invariant, not an implementation of
  mutual exclusion. The 1 ms allocator storm restored one coalesced heap
  block and the starting frame free-list length with ticks live; it did
  not add a lock. Allocator logic stays as it is until M2 picks a
  mechanism.
- **Current enforcement (honest):** the heap sets `IN_ALLOC` around
  `try_alloc` / `insert_coalesced` and panics on re-entry
  (`heap re-entered: size={} align={}`). That is a detector, not a
  critical-section lock — it does not clear `sstatus.SIE`. Frames have
  **no** detector. After D-0065, `alloc_frame` either pops `HEAD` or
  advances `BUMP`, then zeros 4 KiB; `free_frame` writes the old head
  into the frame and then stores `HEAD`. A nested `alloc_frame` between
  the read and the store double-allocates the same PA or double-issues
  the same bump; an interrupt between `free_frame`'s two stores corrupts
  the recycled LIFO list. D-0036's freeze still covers both mutations.
  Both paths are silent. Hardware already clears `SIE` on trap entry, so
  the handler itself is not re-interruptible; the race is the interrupted
  *caller* sitting in the middle of a list mutation when the handler
  mutates the same list.
- **Held only by the handler's current contents.** `trap_handler` calls
  `timer::on_interrupt`, which bumps a counter, programs the next
  deadline, and sometimes `println!` (SBI DBCN bytes from the stack, no
  `GlobalAlloc`, no `alloc_frame`). Nothing in that path touches either
  free list. The storm exercised interrupt-during-mutation under that
  contract and found no corruption. The contract is unenforced: any later
  edit that allocates from the trap path breaks it without a compile
  error.
- **Alternatives considered:** masking `SIE` around frame-list mutation
  now (rejected for this entry: the storm did not find a bug, and this
  task was evidence, not a lock). A frame-side `IN_ALLOC` twin now
  (rejected for the same reason; it would also only catch nesting, not
  a handler that allocates while the caller is *not* in `alloc_frame`).
  Declaring the invariant "good enough because M1's handler is small"
  without recording it (rejected: M2 puts allocation on the trap path
  and the finding would be rediscovered as a Heisenbug).
- **Rationale:** ticks have been live since T1.3, before `frame::init`.
  M1 can keep the invariant by construction because the only trap work
  is a counter and an SBI call. M2 cannot: `ecall` dispatch is a trap,
  and a scheduler that pops frames for task stacks (or a `sbrk` that
  maps them) runs in that path. Once the handler allocates, a timer
  taken in the middle of `alloc_frame` is no longer a harmless
  `on_interrupt` — it is a second walker of an unguarded intrusive list.
- **M2-proofing constraints — these are constraints on M2's design
  session, not suggestions. Do not write M2 code until one of the
  following is an accepted decision:**
  1. **Mask `sstatus.SIE` around frame-list mutation** (`HEAD` read
     through the `HEAD` store in `alloc_frame`; the two stores in
     `free_frame`). Defers a timer until the list is consistent. Does
     not by itself forbid a handler from allocating *after* the mask
     drops.
  2. **A frame-side re-entry detector mirroring `IN_ALLOC`**, panicking
     on nested `alloc_frame` / `free_frame`. Loud, like the heap. Does
     not make the list atomic if the handler allocates while the caller
     is *outside* the allocator, and does not close the interrupt window
     for a non-allocating handler.
  3. **Preallocate everything the trap path could need** (syscall
     scratch, task stacks, whatever `sbrk` / the scheduler would pop)
     so the invariant holds by construction the way M1's timer path
     does. Allocation stays out of `__trap_entry` and `trap_handler`.
- Pick one, or a combination, in the M2 design session. Do not pick
  here. Heap `IN_ALLOC` stays; this entry does not ask M2 to invent a
  second heap policy unless the chosen option forces it.
- **Consequences:** until M2 records that follow-up, adding a `Box`, a
  `Vec`, or an `alloc_frame` under `trap_handler` / `timer::on_interrupt`
  is a bug even if it appears to work. The `just test-stress` storm is
  evidence that the *current* handler is safe, not a license to grow it.

## D-0029: `sscratch` holds the kernel stack top in U-mode and zero in S-mode
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** `sscratch` holds the current task's kernel stack top while
  that task executes in U-mode, and is exactly 0 whenever the hart executes
  in S-mode. D-0020 block 1 becomes `csrrw sp, sscratch, sp` followed by
  `bnez sp, 1f` and, on the not-taken path, a second `csrrw` that undoes the
  first. On the U path only, the entry then stores the trapped `sp` (now in
  `sscratch`) into the frame's `x[2]` slot and reloads the kernel's `gp` with
  relaxation disabled. `trap::install()` writes `sscratch = 0` **before** it
  writes `stvec`.
- **Alternatives considered:** reading `sstatus.SPP` to discriminate
  (rejected: `csrr` needs a destination GPR and at the first instruction of
  the handler every GPR still holds the interrupted context — the swap has to
  come first, and once it has, branching on the swapped-in value is free).
  Keeping a task-control-block pointer in `sscratch` at all times, including
  in S-mode (rejected: then a nested trap from S-mode reuses the same kernel
  stack top and overwrites the outer frame; the zero-in-kernel convention is
  what makes the S path self-restoring). Vectored `stvec` with separate entry
  points (rejected: D-0020 fixed Direct mode, and this would spread the same
  discrimination across a table).
- **Rationale:** on a trap from U-mode all 31 GPRs still hold user values,
  `sp` included, and S-mode stores to `U=0` pages are legal — so a frame
  pushed at the trapped `sp` lets a task nominate kernel memory as the spill
  target and the hardware will not stop it. `sscratch` is the only
  architectural slot the handler owns. The `gp` reload is not cosmetic:
  `_start` loads `gp` with `norelax` precisely so the linker may relax kernel
  absolute loads into `gp`-relative ones, so kernel Rust reached from a
  trap-from-U with the user's `gp` reads the wrong addresses, with no fault and
  no proximity to the cause. `tp` needs no such reload — it is the thread
  pointer, used only for thread-locals, which `no_std` without TLS never
  emits, so the kernel never reads it and saving/restoring it as an ordinary
  GPR is sufficient.
- **Exit-path ordering is part of this decision.** Any instruction executed
  while `sscratch` holds the *user* `sp` in S-mode would misclassify a kernel
  exception as a trap-from-U and push a frame at that address. The exit
  therefore writes user `sp` into `sscratch` as late as it can: after all
  GPRs except `t0` are restored, and after `addi sp, sp, 272` (which
  reconstructs the pre-trap `sp` on the S path and yields `kstack_top` on
  the U path), a branch on saved `sstatus.SPP` covers the two `sscratch`
  instructions. The S path restores `t0` and `sret` with `sscratch` still 0.
  The U path is:

      ld      t0, -256(sp)       # x[2] = user sp; sscratch still 0
      csrw    sscratch, t0       # park — window starts
      ld      t0, -232(sp)       # restore t0 from the frame
      csrrw   sp, sscratch, sp   # swap; sscratch = kstack_top
      sret

  The S-mode-with-user-`sscratch` window is **three instructions, not one**.
  It cannot be shorter: `t0` must be reloaded from the frame *before* the
  `csrrw`, because afterward `sp` points at the user stack and the frame is
  no longer at a known offset from `sp`, and every other GPR already holds
  the interrupted context so there is no spare register to hoist the load.
  The `ld` can only fault if the kernel stack is already blown, which is
  the D-0030 unrecoverable hang — so the window is **safe but not
  fault-free**. `csrw` / `csrrw` touch no memory. After the swap, `sret`
  also runs with `sscratch != 0`, but that value is `kstack_top` (the
  U-mode-ready one) and `sret` cannot fault. `x[2]` stays in the frame as
  the diagnostic copy the panic printer already reports.
- **Consequences:** `sscratch = 0` is now a kernel-wide invariant that any
  future S-mode code path must preserve; the boot CSR snapshot prints
  `sscratch` so firmware garbage is visible rather than assumed. The S path
  costs one extra `csrrw` on every kernel-side trap, which is the price of
  needing no scratch register.

## D-0030: Per-task kernel and user stacks are static and linker-placed, with guard holes
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** each of `MAX_TASKS` (4) task slots gets an 8 KiB kernel stack
  and an 8 KiB user stack, both NOLOAD and placed by the linker script between
  the boot stack and `__kernel_end`, each with a 4 KiB unmapped guard hole
  immediately below it. Task creation allocates nothing.
- **Alternatives considered:** kernel stacks from `frame::alloc_frame()` at
  task creation (rejected on a property of *our* allocator: the free list is
  LIFO over an intrusive list (D-0019), so two frames are not adjacent — an
  8 KiB stack needs contiguity and a guard needs the frame numerically below
  the stack, neither of which the allocator can promise. Making it promise
  them means adding a contiguous-run allocator to serve one caller, which
  D-0014 loses). A single 4 KiB kernel stack per task to avoid the contiguity
  question (rejected: debug builds plus `println!` formatting plus the
  nested-panic path do not fit comfortably, and the failure mode is the silent
  hang below). One shared kernel stack for all tasks (rejected: it only works
  if no task is ever suspended with kernel state live, which is true under
  D-0032 today — but it would make D-0032 load-bearing for memory safety
  rather than for scheduling policy, and M3 would inherit that coupling).
- **Rationale:** static placement buys contiguity and guard holes from the
  linker the same way `.boot_stack` already does (D-0016), and it makes task
  creation allocation-free, which is most of D-0036's answer. It also
  establishes the invariant the trap path depends on: **a task's kernel stack
  is empty whenever that task is in U-mode**, so `sscratch` is a constant per
  task and the frame always lands at `kstack_top - 272`.
- **Kernel stack overflow is NOT handled, and the guard does not make it a
  diagnostic.** Trace it: the overflowing store raises a store page fault from
  S-mode, so `sscratch` is 0, so trap entry keeps the faulting `sp` — already
  inside the guard hole — and block 2's `addi sp, sp, -272` plus its stores go
  through the same hole and fault again. That re-enters `__trap_entry`
  identically, forever. Rust is never reached, so the panic printer and its
  `IN_PANIC` guard never run: **no output, no `scause`, nothing.** This is the
  fault-the-fault-forever case from M1/T1.2 (DEBUGGING.md §4, M1 item 4). The
  guard therefore converts silent corruption of a neighbouring task's stack
  into a silent hang — the damage stops, but nothing is reported. One further
  bound: the guard only guarantees even that much while the overflowing stack
  frame is smaller than the 4 KiB hole; a single frame larger than the guard
  can step clear over it and land the entry's 272-byte push in mapped memory
  below, which is silent corruption again.
- **The standard fix, which M2 does not implement:** a separate double-fault
  stack — on every trap from S-mode, range-check `sp` against the current
  task's kernel stack bounds and switch to a reserved emergency stack when it
  is out of range, so the fault report has somewhere to run. x86 does this in
  hardware (IST); RISC-V S-mode has no equivalent, and there is only one
  `sscratch`, so the second slot would have to be a fixed memory location
  reached by an absolute or `gp`-relative load, plus a comparison, on every
  kernel-side trap. That is a real cost in the hottest path to diagnose a bug
  that should be prevented by keeping frames small. Revisit if a kernel stack
  overflow ever actually costs a debugging session.
- **Consequences (including an M4 threat to validity):** the reserved
  footprint is 8 KiB user stack + 8 KiB kernel stack + two 4 KiB guards +
  64 KiB break window (D-0031) ≈ **88 KiB per task slot**, ~352 KiB for
  `MAX_TASKS = 4`, all NOLOAD. That does not inflate the image, but it *is*
  physical RAM committed up front, so the guest-reported memory footprint M4
  measures against a demand-paged Linux is higher than a fault-driven design
  would report. **M4's report must state this as a methodology difference
  rather than discover it in the numbers:** we commit stacks and break windows
  at link time; Linux reserves address space and populates on fault, so the
  fair comparison is either against Linux's resident set or accompanied by an
  explicit note that our number is a reservation, not a working set.
  Signature and first-response for the overflow hang are in DEBUGGING.md §4.

## D-0031: Separate user sections with the `U` bit; no PTE edits after activation
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** user code and data live in their own linker sections —
  `.utext` (R+X+U), `.urodata` (R+U), `.udata`/`.ubss` (R+W+U) — plus per-task
  user stacks and a 64 KiB per-task break window (R+W+U). All of it is mapped
  by `page::build` at boot, beside the kernel map. **No page-table entry is
  edited after `page::activate`.**
- **Alternatives considered:** marking existing identity-mapped frames `U=1`
  at task creation with a new `page::set_user(va)` (rejected: it needs a
  remap path — today's `map` panics on remap by design (D-0026) — plus an
  `sfence.vma` site, and it puts page-table mutation in the same milestone
  that puts allocation near the trap path; D-0036 wants the opposite
  direction). Placing user code in kernel `.text` and setting `U=1` there
  (impossible, not merely undesirable: S-mode cannot fetch from a `U=1` page,
  so the kernel would stop being able to execute its own text). A kernel
  alias mapping of user buffers at a second `U=0` virtual address so the
  kernel could read them without `SUM` (rejected: it breaks VA = PA for those
  pages and reintroduces the two-views-of-one-buffer bookkeeping a single
  address space (D-0006) exists to avoid, to save two CSR writes).
- **Rationale:** the `U` bit is per-PTE and per-page, so "user code" is a
  placement question before it is a permission question — the sections are the
  minimal way to answer it. Building the whole map at boot keeps the one
  hard-won property from M1 intact: the address space is validated in software
  (T1.6/T2.2) *before* anything runs on it, and it never changes afterwards,
  so there is no TLB-shootdown story and no mapping code reachable from a trap.
- **Consequences:** demo tasks must be written so every symbol referenced
  from `.utext` resolves inside the user sections or the task's own
  stack/break window — no string literals landing in kernel `.rodata`, no
  compiler-emitted `memcpy` call into kernel `.text`, no `gp`/`tp`-relative
  access. `just check-utext` enforces that by resolving `jal`/`auipc+addi`
  (and friends) against those ranges; it does **not** ban `auipc` or `lui`.
  Those instructions are how a legitimate `.urodata` buffer is addressed.
  A `lui` immediate used as a value (a kernel address passed to `write`)
  is not a symbol reference. T2.5 used to read this as "no `auipc`", which
  was only right while `write` was a stub. The 64 KiB break window per
  task is part of the ~88 KiB static reservation recorded in D-0030,
  including its M4 threat-to-validity note.
  **Defense in depth on the break:** `__ubrkN_wall` is the same address as
  `__kstackN_guard`. A `sbrk` bound-check bug that hands out one page past
  the wall therefore lands in the kernel stack's unmapped guard (a store
  page fault from U-mode, which T2.10 kills as a task) rather than in the
  kernel stack itself (`U=0`, S-mode writable). That is not a substitute
  for the software check; it is what makes a missed check a contained
  U-mode fault instead of kernel-stack corruption. M3 replaces the
  in-kernel demo tasks with an app crate linked into these same sections;
  that is a build-integration change, not a mapping change.

## D-0032: Switch at trap exit; the trap frame *is* the task context
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** `trap_handler` changes from taking `&mut TrapFrame` to
  *returning* the frame to resume; block 4 gains `mv sp, a0` before the
  restore sequence. A context switch is therefore "the handler returned a
  different frame pointer than it was given". There is no `swtch`-style
  assembly routine and no second saved-context format: the task control block
  stores no register state, only where its frame lives. The fabricated frame
  for a new task sets `sepc` = entry, `sstatus.SPP` = 0, `SPIE` = 1,
  `x[2]` = `ustack_top`, and `gp` = `tp` = 0.
- **Alternatives considered:** an xv6-style
  `switch(&mut old_ksp, new_ksp)` that saves callee-saved registers and `ra`
  on the kernel stack and returns into a different function than it was called
  from (rejected for M2: it buys the ability to suspend a task *mid-kernel*,
  and no M2 syscall can block — `write` completes into DBCN, `gettime` is one
  `rdtime`, `sbrk` moves a pointer, `yield` and `exit` are scheduler
  operations. It costs a second context format to explain, a synthetic switch
  frame with a fake `ra` for new tasks, and the mind-bender that makes it a
  reading session rather than a paragraph). Storing the user context in the
  TCB and copying it in and out of the frame (rejected: the copy is pure
  overhead — the frame is already a complete context — and it creates two
  places where a register lives).
- **Rationale:** hardware clears `sstatus.SIE` on trap entry and we never set
  it (D-0020), so kernel code is never preempted; with no blocking syscall, a
  task's kernel work always runs to completion. Those two facts mean there is
  exactly one point in the system where a task can lose the CPU — the trap
  epilogue — which is precisely the point where its entire context already
  sits in one 272-byte structure at a known address (`kstack_top - 272`,
  D-0030). Returning a pointer keeps all scheduling policy in Rust and leaves
  the assembly one instruction longer. `gp` and `tp` are zeroed in the
  fabricated frame for the same reason: if user code ever does emit a
  `gp`- or `tp`-relative access, it faults near address 0 immediately instead
  of silently reading kernel data through a register the kernel owns.
- **Consequences:** the handler must have no live Rust state on the outgoing
  task's kernel stack when it returns — it does not: it returns normally, its
  epilogue pops its frames, and only then does block 4 move `sp`. Dead frames
  left below the outgoing task's trap frame are never touched again, because
  resuming that task sets `sp` to its frame at the top of its stack. **The
  known upgrade:** if M3 adds a blocking operation, this design has to become
  the separate save path, and that is a change rather than an addition. The
  mitigation is structural and free — keep "choose the next task" (policy)
  in a function separate from "resume this frame" (mechanism) so a second
  resume path can be added without touching the scheduler. M3 also has the
  option of polling virtio in the task's own context, which keeps this design.

## D-0033: SBI-shaped syscall ABI — number in `a7`, `a0` error and `a1` value
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the syscall number is in `a7`, arguments in `a0`–`a5`, and the
  return is a pair: `a0` = error (0 on success), `a1` = value — written into
  the trap frame, not into registers, because the epilogue restores from the
  frame. Numbering starts at 1: 1 `write`, 2 `exit`, 3 `sbrk`, 4 `gettime`,
  5 `yield`; **0 is reserved and invalid**. Signatures:
  `write(ptr, len) -> count` (console only, no `fd`), `exit(code)` (does not
  return), `sbrk(delta) -> old_break` (0 queries, negative shrinks, past the
  wall returns `NO_MEM` with the break unchanged), `gettime() -> raw time
  counter`, `yield()`. `sepc` advances by the constant 4, citing that RVC has
  `c.ebreak` but no `c.ecall`.
- **Alternatives considered:** a Linux-style single-register return with small
  negative errors in `a0` (rejected: it forces an argument that no legitimate
  return value can look like an error, which here is true only because of our
  memory map — a property of the platform, not of the ABI. The pair costs one
  register and removes the question). Reusing SBI's exact numeric error codes
  (rejected: SBI's list does not contain the errors we need, and a false
  identity is worse than an honest analogy — so the *shape* is SBI's, the
  numbering is ours). A reserved `fd`-like first argument to `write` so M3's
  socket multiplexing would be ABI-compatible (rejected: it is a hook for a
  future milestone, which the standing rules forbid, and the cost of changing
  the ABI later is one edit in the single in-tree caller). `gettime` returning
  nanoseconds (rejected: it hides the 10 MHz timebase that D-0012 makes an
  explicit platform constant, and the app can multiply; the raw counter is
  also exactly what the kernel arms the timer with, and 100 ns resolution is
  what M4's latency bracketing wants).
- **Rationale:** the kernel has spoken this convention since M0 — EID/FID in
  `a7`/`a6`, arguments in `a0`–`a5`, `(error, value)` back — so mirroring it
  means one calling convention in the whole system, which is a legibility
  win: the syscall ABI is the ABI our kernel itself calls. Starting the
  numbering at 1 is the fail-loudly choice: a
  wild jump with a zeroed `a7` lands on "invalid syscall 0" rather than
  silently being `write`.
- **Consequences:** `a1` is clobbered on every syscall return, which the user
  side must know. The five-call wall (D-0010) is unchanged: a need not
  expressible here becomes a decision entry, not a sixth number. M3 will
  likely revisit `write`'s single sink.

## D-0034: Validate user pointers against static intervals; `SUM` only around a validated copy; user faults never panic the kernel
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** every user pointer crossing the syscall boundary is checked by
  `user_range_ok(task, ptr, len)`: reject on `checked_add` overflow, then
  require full containment in one of that task's static intervals — its user
  stack, the live part of its break window, `.udata`+`.ubss`, or `.urodata`
  for read-only sources. `sstatus.SUM` is raised **after** validation, only
  around a `memcpy` inside `copy_from_user` / `copy_to_user`, with a 4 KiB
  per-call cap, and dropped before any formatting or dispatch. A U-mode fault,
  an invalid pointer, or an unknown syscall number **kills the task** — print
  `task N killed: <cause> sepc=… stval=…`, mark it `Exited`, reschedule — and
  never panics the kernel.
- **Alternatives considered:** walking the page table per page and requiring
  `U=1` (rejected: that is what a kernel with a dynamic address space must do;
  here every user interval is fixed by the linker plus one TCB field, so the
  walk re-derives a known fact at O(len/4096) instead of O(1)). Trusting the
  hardware to catch bad pointers (rejected because it cannot: see the
  rationale). Panicking on a bad user pointer (rejected: if a U-mode task can
  take the machine down, the U/S boundary M2 exists to build is decorative).
- **Rationale:** the `U` bit protects user → kernel and nothing else. With
  `SUM=1` the kernel may read `U=1` pages, and it could always read `U=0`
  pages, so a copy loop will faithfully read kernel `.bss` if the task names
  that address — there is no hardware check to enable, and with paging on
  there is no physical back door either, because every S-mode load goes
  through the same translation and the same check. Validation is software or
  it does not exist. Bounding the `SUM` window matters for the same reason in
  reverse: while it is up, every kernel bug that dereferences a wild pointer
  into user memory succeeds instead of faulting, so the window contains a
  `memcpy` and no decisions. The fail-loudly rule still applies where it
  belongs — a violated *kernel* invariant panics; a misbehaving *task* is a
  contained, reported condition, which is the whole point of the privilege
  boundary.
- **Consequences:** the last line of defence is unchanged — if validation is
  correct the kernel never faults on a user pointer, and if it is wrong the
  result is a kernel page fault, which panics loudly with `scause`/`stval`.
  `just test-user-fault` asserts the containment: the faulting task dies, the
  other one finishes, and the run exits 0. Every new interval a task can own
  (M3's app sections) must be added to the validator, or legitimate pointers
  start failing.

  **"User faults never panic the kernel" holds only for the delegated
  subset.** OpenSBI sets `MEDELEG = 0xf0b509`, so codes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
  never reach S-mode (PLAN M1 concept 9). Cause 2 — illegal instruction —
  is the one a task can actually raise: `unimp`, or an FP op with `FS=Off`
  (fabricated `sstatus` leaves FS Off, D-0032). That trap goes to M-mode.
  OpenSBI dumps `mcause`/`mepc`/`mtval` and parks the hart. Our handler
  never runs, so there is no `task N killed` line and no reschedule; the
  machine looks dead. That is outside our containment **by platform design,
  not by choice** — we do not control `medeleg`. Symptom and first-response
  are in DEBUGGING.md §4 (M2). The user-fault selftest therefore loads from
  VA 0 (cause 13, delegated) rather than executing `unimp`.

## D-0035: One tick per slice; no idle loop in M2
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the timeslice is exactly one timer interrupt at the existing
  10 ms period (D-0018) — the handler switches on every tick, so no per-task
  tick counter exists. There is no idle loop and no `Blocked` task state.
- **Alternatives considered:** a multi-tick slice with a counter in the TCB
  (rejected for now: it is a policy knob with no M2 requirement behind it;
  "the slice is the tick" is one sentence and one fewer field). Shortening
  the period to 1 ms for finer preemption (rejected: unnecessary for a demo
  that must show interleaving inside a 3 s hang-guard — and `just test-stress`
  already proved the allocators survive 1 ms ticks, so this stays available at
  no risk). A `wfi` idle task (rejected: unreachable — see rationale).
- **Rationale:** with no blocking syscall there is no state in which a task is
  unrunnable but not finished, so the ready set is empty only when every task
  has exited, and that path shuts the machine down from the last `exit`. An
  idle loop would be code no test could reach, which the standing rule against
  implementing beyond the milestone forbids. A task that yields while it is
  the only runnable one simply gets the CPU back from round-robin.
- **Consequences:** `kmain` never returns once the first task starts, so the
  boot stack is dead from that point and `park()` after it is unreachable.
  The moment M3 introduces a blocking operation, both halves of this entry
  reopen together: a `Blocked` state and an idle loop arrive with it, and
  D-0032's resume path is the third piece.

  **Known fairness property, not a bug.** A syscall-heavy task gets more CPU
  than a compute-heavy one under "slice = one tick". Kernel code runs with
  `SIE = 0` (D-0020), so a pending `STIP` cannot preempt until `sret`. The
  tick is not lost — it fires immediately after `sret` (PLAN M1 concept 3) —
  but the slice has already been stretched by however long the syscall ran.
  Two standard fixes we are **deliberately not doing:**
  1. Charge elapsed time (`rdtime` delta) rather than ticks, so a syscall
     that ate part of the 10 ms slice leaves the remainder.
  2. Make the kernel preemptible (`SIE = 1` in S), so a tick can switch
     mid-syscall.
  Either one reopens D-0020 / D-0028 / D-0036. M2 keeps tick accounting.

## D-0036: Resolve D-0028 by preallocation, enforced with `frame::freeze()`
- Date: 2026-08-14 — Status: accepted (resolves D-0028 for M2)
- **Decision:** M2 takes D-0028's third option — preallocate everything the
  trap path could need, so the "trap handlers must not allocate" invariant
  holds by construction — and enforces it with `frame::freeze()`, called
  immediately before the first `sret` into U-mode. After the freeze,
  `alloc_frame` and `free_frame` panic printing the request. We do **not**
  mask `sstatus.SIE` around frame-list mutation, and we do not add a
  frame-side re-entry detector. Allocator logic is unchanged; the heap keeps
  its existing `IN_ALLOC` detector.
- **Two independent reasons the hazard disappears in M2. They fail
  independently, which is why both are recorded:**
  1. **Nothing in the trap path allocates.** Kernel stacks and user sections
     are static and linker-placed (D-0030, D-0031); the map is complete before
     activation and never edited (D-0031); `sbrk` moves a pointer inside a
     preallocated 64 KiB window. The frame allocator is used only by
     `page::build` at boot. **Broken by:** M3 unfreezing to allocate virtio
     buffers, or any new syscall that backs memory on demand.
  2. **After the first `sret`, no kernel code runs with `SIE = 1` at all.**
     `kmain` never returns (D-0035), so from that point kernel code executes
     only inside trap handlers, where hardware cleared `SIE` and we never set
     it (D-0020). There is no interruptible kernel-side allocator caller left
     to be interrupted. The storm's 20 timer interrupts landed inside
     `alloc_frame` only because `kmain` ran with interrupts enabled.
     **Broken by:** any future kernel-side loop that runs with `SIE = 1` — an
     idle loop that polls, a boot-like phase re-entered later, or M3 polling
     virtio in kernel context with interrupts on.
- **Alternatives considered:** masking `SIE` around the frame-list mutation
  (rejected as M2's answer, and the cost was not the reason: the critical
  section is three instructions in `alloc_frame` — the 4 KiB zeroing stays
  outside it — and two stores in `free_frame`, so the tick jitter is
  nanoseconds. It was rejected because it is the only option that *authorizes*
  allocation from a handler while protecting just one of the structures such a
  handler would touch: a handler that pops a frame while the interrupted code
  was midway through `page::map` corrupts the page table, which no lock on the
  free list protects, and a handler that hits exhaustion panics in interrupt
  context, which is a dead machine rather than a diagnostic. It buys real
  atomicity for one structure and false confidence about the operation).
  A frame-side re-entry detector mirroring `IN_ALLOC` (rejected as
  unnecessary while frozen: the freeze asserts the invariant globally instead
  of catching one failure shape, and it is the stronger check — but the
  detector is the natural fallback the moment M3 unfreezes). Freezing the
  kernel heap too (rejected: `IN_ALLOC` already panics loudly on the shape
  that matters, and freezing would be a claim to walk back the first time a
  diagnostic wants a `String`).
- **Rationale:** the storm found no allocator bug, so the evidence did not ask
  for a lock — it asked why the invariant was unenforced. Preallocation
  removes the hazard's precondition rather than guarding it, which is also
  what M2's design wanted for independent reasons (static stacks come from the
  allocator's inability to promise contiguity, D-0030). `freeze()` converts
  "unenforced invariant held by the handler's current contents" into a loud
  runtime assertion.
- **Consequences:** `just test-stress` still passes because the storm runs
  before the freeze (`stress` never calls `enter`, so it never freezes). Any
  M3 requirement to allocate after boot must reopen this entry explicitly
  rather than quietly calling `unfreeze()`; the likely answer there is `SIE`
  masking plus preallocated pools, and it would amend D-0028 rather than
  replace it. Boot prints `frames frozen: free=N` so the transition is
  visible in every serial log.

  T2.9's scheduler does not break reason 2. After `kmain` the only kernel
  code that runs is `trap_handler` and what it calls (`preempt`, `yield_cpu`,
  `after_exit`, syscall bodies). Hardware clears `SIE` on trap; those
  functions return a frame pointer and never `sstatus::set(SIE)`. `sret`
  restores `SIE` from `SPIE` in U only. There is still no interruptible
  kernel-side allocator caller.

  **7 frames consumed before freeze (was 69 = 67 tables + 2 before
  D-0059).** `frames frozen: free=N` compared with the `FRAME OK` total
  is a gap of 7 on the default image: 5 page tables plus 2. The 5 are
  `page::tables_used()` / `EXPECTED_TABLES` — one Sv39 root, one RAM L1
  (VPN[2]=2 covers `0x8000_0000..0xC000_0000`; L1 slots for the aligned
  RAM interior are 2 MiB leaves, so they allocate no L0), one RAM L0
  for the mixed `0x8020_0000..0x8040_0000` slot (W^X, guards, user
  slots, heap, alignment fragment), plus D-0039's extra L1 (VPN[2]=0)
  and L0 (VPN[1]=0x80) for the virtio-mmio window. Those two MMIO table
  frames come from the RAM pool; the eight MMIO pages themselves do
  not, so `FRAME OK`'s `frames N` (`total_frames()`) does not move. The
  other two held frames are the `FRAME OK` self-test's leftover pair:
  it allocates `a` and `b`, frees `a`, reallocates `c==a`, and never
  frees `b` or `c`. That is a deliberate LIFO check, not a leak to
  plug; freeze then pins them. Feature images can print a different
  `FRAME OK` total (`__heap_end` moves with code size) — `just
  test-stress` compares exhaust's panic against **that boot's**
  `FRAME OK` line, not against `just run`. If `__heap_end` crosses
  `0x8040_0000`, `page::init` panics so `EXPECTED_TABLES` is
  recomputed rather than silently wrong.

## D-0037: Hand-rolled network stack; the TCP scope tripwire
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** M3's network path is written from scratch: Ethernet framing,
  ARP, IPv4, ICMP echo, UDP echo, and a minimal TCP that serves one HTTP
  response to a real client. No smoltcp, no third-party stack, no TLS.
  **Tripwire:** any TCP work beyond "serves one GET to curl, verified in a
  capture" requires M4 to already have first numbers. No retransmission
  tuning, no multiple connections, no feature past the demo until
  measurement exists.
- **Alternatives considered:** `smoltcp` (rejected: it is the sane
  production choice and precisely thereby the wrong one here — the project's
  value is being able to defend every byte of the path, and M4's phase
  decomposition wants a stack whose cost structure we authored). UDP-only
  demo (rejected: the headline metric is boot-to-first-**HTTP**-byte, and
  HTTP-over-TCP against a real client is the credibility line). TLS
  (rejected: an order of magnitude more surface with zero measurement
  value at this layer).
- **Rationale:** the stack is the instrument for M4's measurement, not a
  product. A hand-rolled stack lets every microsecond on the response path
  be attributed to a line we wrote, which is what "find the floor" needs.
  The tripwire exists because TCP is the recognized schedule risk: the
  demo defines done, and measurement — the project's actual deliverable —
  outranks protocol completeness.
- **Consequences:** our TCP is honest about what it omits (D-0041) and the
  report may not make throughput or robustness claims beyond the demo. The
  tripwire is enforced structurally: M3's task list ends at T3.12 and
  contains no TCP-polish task.

## D-0038: Modern virtio-mmio, split virtqueue, static DMA pool; the freeze stands
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the driver speaks modern virtio-mmio (version 2, forced with
  `-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false`) with split virtqueues, 16
  descriptors per queue, negotiating `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1` and
  `VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC` only — no `MRG_RXBUF`, so RX buffers are 2048 bytes,
  whole-frame, single-descriptor chains. Rings and buffers are page-aligned
  statics in kernel `.bss` (RX 16×2048 + TX 8×2048 + rings ≈ 64 KiB): the
  frame allocator is never touched, `frame::freeze()` stands verbatim, and
  D-0036's reason 1 survives unamended. RX buffers are re-posted after
  consumption, never freed — the NIC owns a fixed set of 24 buffers from
  boot to shutdown; there is no buffer allocation path.
  `virtq::verify()` runs before `DRIVER_OK` (the T1.6 move): alignment
  16/2/4, every descriptor address inside the pool and identity-mapped,
  indices zero, and the six queue-address registers read back and compared.
  Memory barriers from day one: `fence w,w` before the avail-idx store,
  `fence w,o` before the notify store, `fence r,r` after reading used-idx.
- **Alternatives considered:** legacy virtio-mmio (rejected: page-shifted
  `QueuePFN` forces the three structures into one contiguous layout and the
  10/12-byte header ambiguity into the fast path; "we speak the current
  spec" is the honest position). `MRG_RXBUF` (rejected:
  buys nothing at one connection and adds descriptor-chain walking).
  Preallocating the pool from the frame allocator before freeze (rejected:
  buffer addresses would depend on allocation order and the pool would need
  its own bookkeeping; statics are placed by the linker and verifiable by
  name). Unfreezing plus a frame-side detector (rejected: reopens the
  exact hazard D-0036 closed, and D-0036 predicted this moment).
- **Rationale:** D-0036 expected M3 to need the allocator; it does not,
  because everything the NIC touches is fixed-size and known at link time —
  the same static-preallocation logic that produced D-0030's task slots.
  The barriers are written although QEMU's device model will likely hide
  their absence: a bug that cannot be provoked on the only test platform
  must be prevented by review, not testing.
- **Consequences:** 24 buffers cap in-flight traffic — irrelevant at one
  connection, recorded for M4's threats-to-validity. The pool is dead
  weight in netless images (~64 KiB of `.bss`; nothing, against 128 MiB).
  `virtq::verify()` joins the boot cost that `fast-boot` may eventually
  strip, with the same price-of-paranoia accounting as the map verify.

  **T3.2: the six queue-address registers are write-only.** Virtio 1.2
  §4.2.2 marks QueueDesc/QueueDriver/QueueDevice Low/High as write-only.
  QEMU 8.2 `virtio_mmio_read` returns 0 and logs `LOG_GUEST_ERROR`, so a
  FEATURES_OK-style readback cannot catch a wrong offset or a swapped
  high/low word on this transport — a missed write and a successful write
  both read as 0. The load-bearing guards are: a single `write_addr`
  helper that always stores `gpa as u32` at `off` and `gpa >> 32` at
  `off+4` (swapped halves are unrepresentable at the call site); named
  offsets citing the spec; and `verify()` still reading both halves, so a
  device that implements the registers as RW panics on mismatch
  (`wrote=… read=…; wrong offset or swapped high/low`). A zero read of a
  nonzero write is printed as write-only MMIO, not treated as a match.
  QueueReady is readable and must stay 0 across the write+verify window
  — that one readback *does* work, and it is what keeps the device from
  owning the ring while we check it.

## D-0039: Map the virtio-mmio window at build; map-then-probe
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted (amends D-0025; D-0031 intact)
- **Decision:** `page::build` maps the 8-page virtio-mmio window
  `0x1000_1000..0x1000_9000` (8 transports, 0x1000 stride, QEMU
  `hw/riscv/virt.c`) as R+W, never X, U=0, at boot, before `activate`.
  Discovery probes all 8 slots after paging is on. No PTE is edited after
  activation — D-0031's ban stands. Every QEMU invocation in the harness
  gains the NIC flags so feature images do not diverge from the default
  boot.
- **Alternatives considered:** probe-then-map (impossible under D-0031:
  probing reads the magic register, which requires a mapped page — the
  no-edit rule forces map-then-probe). Mapping only the discovered slot
  (same impossibility). Relaxing D-0031 with a one-shot post-activation
  map call (rejected: the one hard-won M1 property is that the address
  space is validated before anything runs on it and never changes; eight
  pages of window is a small price for keeping it).
- **Rationale:** D-0025 already contained its own amendment clause — "M3
  adds the virtio pages in the same task that adds the driver" — and this
  entry is that clause exercised. The permissions are justified against
  the code that uses them: the driver reads/writes device registers (R+W)
  and nothing fetches from device memory (never X).
- **Consequences:** eight pages of device memory are now reachable by a
  stray kernel pointer that previously would have faulted — the cost
  D-0025's rationale conceded the moment a driver exists. The T2.2 verify
  walk asserts the window's mapping and permissions. sifive_test remains
  unmapped (D-0017's escape hatch stays an `ecall`). Mapping a new VPN[2]
  costs two page-table frames (L1 + L0); `tables_used` is 5
  (`EXPECTED_TABLES`; D-0059 mixed granularity: root + RAM L1 + one
  RAM L0 + these two MMIO tables) and freeze holds 7 (5 tables + 2
  self-test leftovers). The MMIO pages are not RAM, so the frame
  allocator's `total_frames()` / `FRAME OK` count is untouched.

## D-0040: Driver and stack in the kernel; `recv`/`send`; polling, no PLIC
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted (amends D-0010 and D-0033)
- **Decision:** the virtio driver and the entire network stack live in the
  kernel. The app talks payloads over two new syscalls — `recv` (6):
  `recv(buf, len) → (err, n)`, returning request payload or an
  `EAGAIN`-style error, **each call polling the NIC and advancing the
  stack**; `send` (7): `send(buf, len, flags)`, a FIN flag bit closing the
  connection. One listener, one connection at a time, no accept, no fds.
  Polling only: the PLIC stays unmapped and uninitialized in M3. Two
  invariants: **the NIC is touched only from syscall context** (never from
  the trap path — networking adds zero code to the path D-0028 constrains;
  TCP's timer is driven from `recv` polling via `rdtime`, not the tick
  handler), and **remote bytes are user input** (a malformed packet
  increments a counter and is dropped; it never panics the kernel —
  D-0034's spirit extended to the wire).
- **Alternatives considered:** raw-frame syscalls with the stack in the app
  (rejected: every packet crosses U/S twice through the SUM window instead
  of twice per connection; TCP timers would depend on a task that might be
  spinning elsewhere; and the whole stack becomes compiled-Rust-in-`.utext`,
  multiplying T3.9's checker risk by the stack's size). Everything in the
  task with MMIO and rings mapped U=1 (rejected outright: a U-writable
  descriptor table lets user code point device DMA at kernel memory — the
  U/S boundary the project exists to measure becomes decorative exactly
  where it matters). PLIC interrupts (rejected for M3: init cost lands in
  the boot path the headline metric measures, and per-packet trap entry
  plus claim/complete MMIO round-trips land in the response path; polling
  costs host CPU, which the metric does not price — a single-purpose VM
  serving one request has nothing better to do with the core). Multiplexing
  over `write` (rejected: overloading the console syscall with a channel
  argument saves one number at the cost of the ABI's legibility).
- **Rationale:** the response path is RX-used-ring → TCP → TX-avail-ring
  entirely in S-mode, with exactly two U/S crossings for the whole
  connection. The layering story is defensible: the kernel is the
  transport, the app is the HTTP server — mirroring real OS structure and
  what Unikraft's lib-stack does inside its single domain. D-0035 survives
  untouched: no Blocked state, no idle loop — a task waiting for a packet
  is running, spinning on `recv`, and that spin *is* the poll loop.
- **Consequences:** the five-syscall wall becomes seven, by decision entry
  as D-0010 prescribed. M2's polling-first recommendation is upgraded to
  no-PLIC-in-M3; if M4's data ever wants interrupt-driven numbers for the
  comparison, that is a new entry. The app cannot be given a second
  connection without reopening this entry.

## D-0041: Minimal TCP: passive open, stop-and-wait, one fixed RTO
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** passive open only. States: LISTEN → SYN_RCVD → ESTABLISHED
  → FIN_WAIT_1 → FIN_WAIT_2 → truncated TIME_WAIT (log and drop to CLOSED
  immediately), plus CLOSE_WAIT → LAST_ACK for the peer-closes-first race.
  Duplicate SYN in SYN_RCVD re-sends the SYN/ACK. ISN from `rdtime` low
  bits. MSS parsed from the SYN; all other options skipped via the data
  offset field, which is honored on every segment. Fixed 8 KiB advertised
  window. Stop-and-wait transmission: at most one unacked data segment in
  flight, retransmitted on a fixed 200 ms `rdtime` deadline checked from
  the polling loop, 8 attempts then RST. Anything unexpected gets RST plus
  a counter — never silence, never a panic. Checksums with pseudo-header
  in both directions. SYN and FIN each consume a sequence number.
- **Alternatives considered:** no retransmission at all (defensible on a
  near-lossless slirp leg and rejected anyway: the failure symptom is curl
  hanging forever with nothing on serial — the single worst debugging
  experience available in this project — bought back for ~30 lines; a
  stack without retransmission is also not honestly called TCP).
  Congestion control, window scaling, SACK, timestamps (all rejected: the
  response is one segment; there is no window to grow and no loss pattern
  to recover; each is listed so the report can say what was omitted and
  why the omission is invisible at this workload). Full TIME_WAIT
  (rejected: a one-shot server holding 2MSL state serves nothing; the
  consequence — a retransmitted peer FIN meets RST — is visible in the
  capture and harmless).
- **Rationale:** the peer is libslirp (D-0042), which negotiates MSS and
  little else, so the design rules that matter are the ones that keep any
  naive stack alive against any peer: honor data offset (the number-one
  naive-stack killer is assuming 20-byte headers), get the SYN/FIN
  sequence-number consumption right (the off-by-one produces
  hangs-at-close that masquerade as retransmit bugs), ACK unconditionally
  on in-order receipt, and say RST when confused so the capture shows it.
- **Consequences:** sequenced to land with demonstrable checkpoints —
  handshake in pcap (T3.10), data + close + provoked retransmit + curl
  end-to-end (T3.11). The tripwire (D-0037) applies beyond that line. A
  browser (multiple parallel connections) is out of scope by construction;
  curl is the demo client.

## D-0042: Static network configuration; no DHCP; slirp is the peer
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the guest uses QEMU user-net's contractual constants
  statically: 10.0.2.15/24, gateway 10.0.2.2. No DHCP client. The TCP/UDP
  demo ports arrive via `hostfwd`. It is recorded plainly that under
  user-net the guest's TCP peer is **libslirp's internal stack** — a
  `hostfwd` connection is terminated on the host side and re-originated
  from 10.0.2.2 — and that inbound ICMP echo is unroutable, so ICMP is
  exercised guest→out (ping 10.0.2.2, slirp answers).
- **Alternatives considered:** DHCP (rejected: burns boot milliseconds to
  discover constants — the wrong direction for a boot-to-first-byte
  metric — and adds a UDP client state machine with no measurement value;
  the Linux baseline gets static config too, preserving comparability).
  Tap networking for a real host-kernel peer (rejected for M3: needs
  root/setup and breaks the "runs anywhere per SETUP.md" property;
  recorded as the M4 threat-to-validity escape hatch if a hostile TCP
  peer is ever needed).
- **Rationale:** slirp's addressing is documented, stable API surface, not
  guesswork. The de-risking is honest: curl's kernel-grade TCP options
  never reach us, which makes the demo achievable, and the pcap — not the
  claim "survives a real client" — is the arbiter of protocol correctness.
- **Consequences:** the M4 report's threats-to-validity section inherits
  the slirp-termination caveat verbatim. If the demo ever moves to tap,
  ARP stops being a one-gateway affair and this entry reopens.

## D-0043: Measurement edges, `fast-boot`, capture in the harness
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the boot-to-first-HTTP-byte edges are named: E0 = host
  clock at QEMU exec; E1 = machine start (`mtime` ≈ 0); E2 = kernel entry
  (`rdtime` at `_start`); E3g = `rdtime` at response-TX publish;
  E3w = pcap timestamp of that frame; E4 = first byte at the client.
  E0→E4 is both the honest and the comparable number (identical harness,
  no guest cooperation required); E2→E3g decomposed by phase at 100 ns
  `rdtime` resolution is the floor number, available for Whimbrel only
  (stated, not hidden). Divergences are reported where they occur:
  E3w−E3g prices virtio+slirp transit, E4−E3w the host-side remainder
  after the HTTP frame is in the filter-dump (D-0066: not a µs
  loopback; tens of milliseconds on this host), E0→E1
  QEMU init shared by all systems. The client runs a tight (~1 ms)
  connect-retry loop started before E0; boot-to-ready (E0 → first
  successful connect) is reported alongside. **The E2 assumption is
  validated, not assumed:** T3.12(a) freezes the machine at reset and
  reads `time` via GDB before the first guest instruction; the observed
  offset is recorded in this entry when measured, and the firmware row of
  the M4 table cites the measurement. Phase timestamps live in a static
  array and are printed only after the response is sent (DBCN is one
  `ecall` per byte). A `fast-boot` cargo feature (same codebase, sibling
  shape) removes the boot tick wait, self-tests, and non-essential prints;
  it **keeps the map verify initially**, and the safe/fast delta is
  reported as the price-of-paranoia finding. The M1 timer acceptance moves,
  not vanishes: the default profile's 30-tick wait shrinks to 3 ticks with
  `tick 3` on serial, and timer coverage also holds structurally (the
  T2.9 preemption counters cannot advance without live ticks). Packet
  capture (`-object filter-dump`) is standing harness infrastructure from
  the first TX packet onward; `tshark` joins SETUP.md and
  `scripts/install.sh` as a dependency so assertions run everywhere the
  harness does. Full determinism is not promised — slirp timing rides
  host scheduling; the harness promises reproducible statistics (N
  trials, median/IQR, pinned QEMU version) plus a pcap per run.
  **Unikraft baseline:** the riscv64 port is an open PR
  (unikraft/unikraft#1698, rebased June 2026; kraftkit riscv64 merged), so
  the M4 comparison rests on a timeboxed feasibility spike at the M3/M4
  boundary with a recorded fallback ladder: (1) it works — full three-way
  under identical conditions; (2) runs only on arm64/x86_64 — two-way
  riscv64 head-to-head as primary, Unikraft as a labeled different-ISA
  reference; (3) does not run — two-way plus qualitative boot-path
  analysis from source.
- **Alternatives considered:** first-serial-byte as the readiness edge
  (rejected as primary: serial cost differs across guests and is not the
  service the user waits for; kept as a secondary marker). `-icount` for
  determinism (rejected: does not tame the slirp/host boundary and
  distorts the host-clock edges the comparison needs). Stripping the map
  verify in `fast-boot` from the start (rejected: it is the project's
  signature safety net, and "we measured the cost of our own verification"
  is itself a result — it gets stripped only if the phase data shows it
  matters, as a recorded amendment).
- **Rationale:** a benchmark whose edges are not pinned before measurement
  drifts toward the number its author wanted. Naming E0–E4 now, validating
  E2, and building the instrumentation into T3.12 makes M4 a measurement
  exercise instead of a definition argument.
- **Consequences:** boot prints nothing new on the measured path; the
  phase block appears after first-byte. The `fast-boot` profile is a
  feature flag, not a fork — the sibling-selftest pattern already proves
  the shape. **E2 offset, measured T3.12(a):** QEMU `-S` at reset,
  `pc=0x1000` (OpenSBI), GDB `$time` = **0**. `rdtime` at `_start` is
  therefore the OpenSBI phase with nothing to subtract. Re-measure with
  `just measure-e2` if the firmware or QEMU version changes.
  **T3.12 wrap amendment (2026-08-16):** Headline boot-to-first-byte uses a
  client retry loop started **before E0** (`CLIENT_EARLY=1`,
  `just test-fast-release`). `sret→E3g` on `just test` / `just test-fast`
  is waiting for `HTTP READY` then spawning curl — that is harness time,
  not kernel work, and is not the M4 number. Kernel boot-to-ready is
  E2→sret (stack-ready is E2→listen). Debug `opt-level=0` paging (~150 ms
  walking ~32k pages twice) is not the cost of paging; M4 cites
  `cargo build --release --features fast-boot`. The default `just test`
  curl-after-`HTTP READY` path stays a correctness gate. Release LTO
  constant-folds `==` of distinct linker symbols (DEBUGGING.md §4.14);
  `task::pa` / page / virtq address helpers `black_box` those loads.

## D-0044: App crate in the user sections; check-utext bans FP, including compressed
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the M3 app is a real crate linked into the existing user
  sections — the linker script matches the app archive's
  `.text/.rodata/.data/.bss` into `.utext/.urodata/.udata/.ubss` — with a
  `usys` wrapper crate for the syscalls. `check-utext` grows to handle
  compiled-Rust output and **rejects every floating-point instruction in
  `.utext`: the F/D mnemonics and the compressed forms** — `c.fld`,
  `c.fsd`, `c.fldsp`, `c.fsdsp` — the encodings a compiler emits silently
  and a naive mnemonic list misses (llvm-objdump may print either
  spelling; both are banned). `sstatus.FS` stays Off.
- **Alternatives considered:** enabling FS so FP just works (rejected: the
  TrapFrame saves no FP state, so it is only safe while exactly one task
  uses FP — an invariant nobody is checking two milestones from now; and
  the demo needs no floats). Building the app for a soft-float target
  (rejected: `riscv64gc`'s hard-float ABI and a soft-float ABI cannot link
  into one image). Trusting that integer HTTP code emits no FP (rejected:
  hope is not a gate; the checker already fails closed on unknown forms,
  so the ban is a natural extension).
- **Rationale:** an FP instruction from U-mode with FS=Off is an
  **undelegated illegal instruction** — OpenSBI dump, hart parked, no
  `task N killed` line, the M2 known limit and the worst failure mode in
  the project. The choice is to handle it at runtime (enable FS, save FP
  state) or make it unrepresentable at build time; the checker already
  exists and the demo has no floats, so unrepresentable wins.
- **Consequences:** the app crate must avoid `f32`/`f64` end to end
  (formatting included); a violation fails `just check-utext` by name
  rather than parking the hart silently. If a future milestone needs FP in
  U-mode, this entry reopens together with a TrapFrame FP-state design.
  T3.9 carries the checker work and its acceptance includes a planted
  `c.fld` being caught.

## D-0045: ARP cache wraparound is exercised at init, then cleared
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the 4-entry ARP cache's wraparound eviction runs a
  five-insert self-test at driver init (distinct synthetic IPs), asserts
  the oldest is gone and the newest four remain, prints `ARP CACHE WRAP
  OK`, then **clears** the table so dummy entries do not shadow the
  gateway. slirp only ever offers one peer (10.0.2.2); a wraparound path
  that ships unrun is an untested path.
- **Alternatives considered:** leave wraparound untested and document it
  (rejected: the user-facing rule is not to ship an unrun wrap; a comment
  is not a test). Wait for five real peers (rejected: they will not
  arrive). Keep the dummy entries after the self-test (rejected: they
  occupy the only slots the gateway then has to evict into — a live
  table polluted by a test).
- **Rationale:** a 4-slot ring whose occupancy never exceeds 1 is a lie
  about being a cache. The self-test is the same shape as `heap::self_test`
  / `frame::self_test`: prove the invariant on every boot, then leave
  production state clean.
- **Consequences:** every image that reaches `net::init` prints
  `ARP CACHE WRAP OK`. `just test` greps it. If eviction breaks, boot
  panics before any packet.

## D-0046: T3.6 ARP test does not depend on GARP teaching slirp
- Date: 2026-08-15 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the first hostfwd connect fires on `DRIVER_OK`, which is
  printed **before** the GARP (T3.5 item 10: slirp caches a GARP and
  then never ARPs). That connect is the ARP trigger. After the guest
  prints `TX ARP reply`, the harness connects a **second** time. Pcap
  asserts slirp's request, then our unicast reply, then IPv4
  10.0.2.2→10.0.2.15 with a later frame number. The GARP still goes out
  after the reply so T3.4's greps hold; it is not how this test teaches
  slirp our MAC.
- **Alternatives considered:** skip the GARP for this task (rejected:
  T3.4 acceptance still runs on the same boot). Fire the first connect
  after the GARP (rejected: that is the T3.5 failure — no request).
  Treat the first connect's SYN as the "proceeds past ARP" proof
  (rejected: the stated acceptance is a *subsequent* connect; relying
  on slirp sending SYN on the same attempt that elicited ARP couples
  the proof to one slirp timing). A second QEMU `-netdev` trick or a
  static ARP on the host (rejected: extra moving parts; two connects
  on the existing hostfwd is the same trigger T3.5 already uses).
- **Rationale:** GARP-caching makes "one connect after DRIVER_OK"
  order-dependent. Splitting provoke (connect #1, before GARP, must
  ARP) from prove (connect #2, after our reply, must be IPv4) keeps
  both halves deterministic.
- **Consequences:** `scripts/boot-test.sh` waits for `TX ARP reply`
  before the second `provoke-hostfwd` **on `net-init-selftest` only**
  (D-0054). `assert-pcap-arp-reply.sh` fail-closes on request-only,
  reply-before-request, and reply-without a later IPv4 frame.
  Panic/hang images never print `DRIVER_OK` and are not provoked.
  **T3.12 wrap amendment:** After D-0054 the guest ARPs `10.0.2.2`
  itself; slirp often never ARPs us, so `TX ARP reply` is not a boot
  event. The watcher fires **one** `provoke-hostfwd` after
  `gateway 10.0.2.2 MAC learned` (cache full, SYN not `noarp`). The
  slirp-asked-first pcap chain (`assert-pcap-slirp-arp.sh`,
  `assert-pcap-arp-reply.sh`) is no longer a live gate; the scripts
  remain for fail-closed coverage of the scripts themselves.
  `just test-net-init` / `just test-net-tcp` keep the handshake asserts;
  `net-init-selftest` stays in `poll_rx` until ESTABLISHED and LISTEN
  restore so the feature image does not exit during ping.

## D-0047: TX uses the ARP cache; empty gateway is a panic, not a queue
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** every IPv4 TX is Ethernet-unicast to the **gateway**
  MAC (`10.0.2.2`) looked up in the ARP cache. There is no routing
  table. If that lookup misses, the driver **panics** by name. It does
  not emit an ARP request, and it does not queue the datagram. T3.7's
  ping runs after `wait_gateway_arp` (D-0054), which learns 10.0.2.2 from
  slirp's reply to our request; an empty cache at that point is a real
  resolution failure, not a missed hostfwd window.
- **Alternatives considered:** ARP-then-queue (rejected: there is no TX
  queue, and a pending ICMP datagram plus a wait-for-ARP loop is a
  second protocol on the same descriptor we reuse after `wait_tx`).
  Broadcast the IP datagram (rejected: slirp would still ARP, and we
  would be sending IPv4 to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). Hard-code QEMU's slirp
  MAC (rejected: the cache would be ornamental; T3.6 already proved
  learn-from-request).
- **Rationale:** fail loudly. A silent drop looks like slirp never
  answered the ping; a panic saying `no MAC for gateway 10.0.2.2`
  names the missing precondition. The guest-initiated ping is sequenced
  after the cache is populated, so the panic is a regression alarm, not
  a startup race.
- **Consequences:** `arp::lookup([10,0,2,2])` is the only L2 resolution
  IPv4 has. The echo-reply path uses the same lookup even though the
  IPv4 destination is the requester — Ethernet dest is still the
  gateway (no routing). T3.12 (D-0054) fills the cache with an ARP
  request at init; an empty cache after that wait is a real miss.

## D-0048: ICMP echo server exists; slirp only lets us test the client
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** type 8 → type 0 (echo reply) is implemented: copy
  identifier/sequence/data, recompute the ICMP checksum, swap IPv4
  addresses, TX to the gateway MAC. **The harness cannot exercise that
  half.** Under `-netdev user`, inbound ICMP echo is unroutable
  (PLAN concept 4, D-0042); a host `ping 10.0.2.15` never arrives as
  an RX used-ring entry. The tested direction is guest→out: we ping
  10.0.2.2, slirp answers. A build self-test (`ICMP REPLY BUILD OK`)
  proves the reply writer produces a checksum-valid type-0 copy; it is
  not a wire test. RTT is `rdtime` at the 10 MHz virt timebase
  (`timer::TICK_NS` = 100): one line
  `PING RTT dst=10.0.2.2 id= seq= tx= rx= ticks= ns=` so M4 can parse
  the same keys rather than a one-off debug print. `tx` is `rdtime` at
  QueueNotify of our echo request; `rx` is `rdtime` when the matching
  echo reply is classified. `ns = ticks * 100`.
- **Alternatives considered:** skip the server path because slirp cannot
  deliver inbound echo (rejected: "untested" and "unimplemented" must
  stay distinct; the limitation is recorded, the code is not omitted).
  Test inbound via tap (rejected for M3: D-0042; tap is the M4
  escape hatch). Print only microseconds (rejected: the native unit is
  `rdtime` ticks; ns is a scaled copy of the same integer, not a
  different clock).
- **Rationale:** an echo server that exists only in a comment is how
  the dishonest skip happens. Shipping the type-8 path and saying
  plainly that user-net cannot feed it keeps the claim honest: the client
  RTT is the acceptance; the server is correct by
  construction and untested on the wire.
- **Consequences:** `just test` greps `PING RTT` and asserts pcap
  echo-request then echo-reply. It does not send a host ping. Malformed
  IPv4/ICMP counters (`csum`, `frag`, `ihl`, …) must read 0 on that
  path; `ipv4 drop_proto` may be non-zero because hostfwd SYNs are
  IPv4/TCP, not malformed. **That exception expired at T3.10 (D-0049);
  `just test` now requires `proto=0`.**

## D-0049: `drop_proto` hostfwd-SYN exception expires at T3.10
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** through T3.9, `ipv4 drop_proto` is allowed to be
  non-zero on the happy path. The hostfwd TCP connects that provoke
  slirp ARP (T3.5/T3.6) deliver protocol 6 to a stack that only handles
  ICMP (1) and UDP (17). That is expected noise, **named as temporary**.
  T3.10 (TCP passive open) **removes the exception**: once we parse
  SYNs, a non-zero `drop_proto` means an unknown protocol, not a
  hostfwd SYN, and it must not sit in the "expected noise" category.
  `just test` requires `proto=0`. The `ipv4: drop proto=6 (TCP; expected
  until T3.10)` print is gone: protocol 6 is delivered to `tcp`.
- **Alternatives considered:** stop sending hostfwd connects after ARP
  is cached (rejected: T3.6's second connect is the "past ARP" proof).
  Classify TCP as a separate `drop_tcp` that stays non-zero forever
  (rejected: that launders the exception past T3.10). Ignore proto=6
  without a counter (rejected: silent).
- **Rationale:** a counter that is "allowed to be whatever" is how
  real drops hide. Dating the exception to the task that makes it
  false keeps T3.10 from inheriting T3.7's excuse.
- **Consequences:** T3.8 did not grep `proto=0`. T3.10 deleted the
  exception: `just test` / `just test-net-init` fail the boot if
  `drop_proto != 0` on the happy path. Do not "fix" it by stopping
  the hostfwd watcher.

## D-0050: UDP echo swaps ports and addresses; checksum 0 is 0xFFFF
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** UDP echo on guest port 7 (`hostfwd=udp::7777-:7`).
  Parse/build uses the 12-byte IPv4 pseudo-header (src, dst, zero,
  protocol 17, UDP length) plus the real UDP header and payload.
  UDP length is summed **twice** — once in the pseudo-header, once
  as the Length field in the real header — that is RFC 768, not a
  double-count bug. A computed checksum of 0 is transmitted as
  `0xFFFF` (0 means "no checksum"). On RX, checksum 0 is **dropped**
  (`drop_csum`) — a **deliberate deviation from RFC 768**, which
  permits zero to mean "no checksum was computed." We do not treat
  optional-checksum as valid. slirp always fills in a real checksum,
  so the QEMU user-net peer never exercises the RFC's zero; a
  real-world peer that legitimately sends 0 is dropped by this
  policy, not by accident. Echo **mirrors** payload and UDP length,
  **swaps** source/dest ports and IPv4 addresses, **recomputes** IP
  checksum, UDP checksum, TTL, and Ethernet dest (gateway MAC). The
  harness waits for serial `UDP ECHO READY` before sending; the
  client is a datagram socket with a 2 s recv timeout (the `nc -u`
  shape) so a silent guest is TEST FAIL, not a hang.
- **Alternatives considered:** accept RX checksum 0 per RFC 768
  (rejected: that is skipping verification, the T3.7 dishonest skip
  applied to UDP; recorded here as a named deviation rather than
  left implicit, because a non-slirp peer may send zero in good
  faith). Rebuild the datagram from parsed fields (rejected:
  echo is a swap; rebuilding is how payload bytes get lost). Fire
  `nc -u` on `DRIVER_OK` (rejected: the guest is still in ARP/ping;
  UDP would sit in the used ring or be dropped as proto-not-yet).
  Call distro `nc -u` directly (rejected: EOF/timeout behavior is not
  portable; a SOCK_DGRAM + `settimeout` is the same packet and is
  fail-closed).
- **Rationale:** the pseudo-header and the 0/`0xFFFF` wrinkle live in
  `udp.rs` with a self-test that
  forces a zero computed sum. Dropping RX 0 is stricter than the RFC
  and is defensible against slirp (it always computes one) but is
  still a protocol choice, not "the RFC says so." The harness race
  is the same lesson as T3.5: provoke only after the guest has
  printed that it is polling for this packet.
- **Consequences:** every QEMU invocation gains
  `hostfwd=udp::7777-:7`. `just test-net-udp` is a sibling feature
  (`net-udp-selftest`) so the default boot does not spin 2 s waiting
  for a datagram `just test` never sends. T3.9 moved the echo into the
  app over `recv`/`send`; this entry's wire behavior stays.
  Revisit RX-0 if a non-slirp peer (tap, M4) needs optional-checksum.

## D-0051: Compiled Rust in `.utext` stays inside the app/usys archives
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** T3.9 links a real `app` crate (and a `usys` wrapper) into
  the existing user sections via linker `EXCLUDE_FILE` on those
  archives' `.text/.rodata/.data/.bss` (D-0044). The image has **one**
  `#[panic_handler]` lang item, and it stays in the kernel: S-mode
  cannot fetch `U=1` pages (SUM does not affect instruction fetch),
  and U-mode cannot fetch `U=0` pages, so a single handler cannot
  serve both. The app crate therefore does not carry a lang-item
  panic handler. Its abort path is `usys::exit` / `unimp` in `.utext`.
  The app is written so rustc does not emit calls into `core`'s
  panicking/fmt/builtins: no `panic!`/`unwrap`/`expect`, no indexing
  that can fail, no `format!`/`println!`, no `f32`/`f64`, overflow
  checks and debug assertions off on the `app` and `usys` packages,
  `opt-level = 1` so small copies inline instead of calling
  `memcpy`/`memset`. `-C no-redzone` is an x86 concern; RISC-V has
  no red zone, so the flag is a no-op here and is not set. `panic =
  "abort"` is already the workspace profile (no unwinder /
  `eh_personality` in either half). `check-utext` requires `app_main`
  to sit in `[__utext_start, __utext_end)` so a failed section match
  cannot hide in kernel `.text`. Unknown mnemonics stay a hard
  error; FP including `c.fld`/`c.fsd`/`c.fldsp`/`c.fsdsp` is
  rejected by name (D-0044). `recv` (6) / `send` (7) join the ABI;
  0 stays reserved; numbers `>= 8` still kill. UDP `send` ignores
  the FIN bit (T3.10's TCP close); a task waiting on a packet stays
  `Running` and spins on `recv` (D-0035, D-0040).
- **Alternatives considered:** `#[panic_handler]` in the app crate as
  well as the kernel (rejected: rustc allows one `panic_impl` per
  image; a second compilation + `objcopy --redefine-sym` is how
  you fake two, and that is exactly the archive-boundary iteration
  this task is forbidden to wander into). Putting the one lang item
  in `.utext` (rejected: a kernel `panic!` would instruction-fault
  fetching U=1 text). `panic = "immediate-abort"` (rejected: needs
  nightly `-Zunstable-options` on 1.97). Sharing `core` helpers
  that are not inlined (rejected: those objects already live in
  kernel `.text`; an `auipc+jalr` from `.utext` into them is the
  silent-wrong outcome `check-utext` exists to catch). Building the
  app for a soft-float target (rejected: D-0044, ABI mismatch).
  Growing `check-utext` with a permissive default for unknown ops
  (rejected: the checker's contract is fail-closed). A `Blocked`
  state for `recv` (rejected: D-0035). Kernel auto-echo remaining
  in `classify_udp` "for the harness" (rejected: T3.9's acceptance
  is the echo moving into the app).
- **Rationale:** the structural risk is not the echo logic; it is
  LLVM emitting a symbol that resolves outside the user sections.
  The mitigations are "don't generate that call" plus a checker
  that fails if we did. The panic-handler split is hardware: two
  privilege levels, one identity map, one lang item.
- **Consequences:** rustc passes `libapp-HASH.rlib` whose members are
  `app-HASH.*.rcgu.o`, and LLVM names string literals
  `.rodata..Lanon.*`. Matching only `*libapp-*.rlib:(.rodata)` left
  those strings in kernel `.rodata` (`auipc` from `.utext` into
  `0x8022xxxx`). The working placement is `#[link_section]` on user
  functions and data, plus matching both the rlib and the `*.rcgu.o`
  member names. If that pairing breaks, **stop** and inspect
  `cargo rustc -- --print link-args` — do not iterate wildcards.
  Symptom of the silent case: `app_main` at `0x8020xxxx`, every test
  green until the first `sret`. The planted `c.fld` image is a
  build-only feature (`utext-c-fld-selftest`); it must not ship in
  the default kernel. `net-udp-selftest` drops `no-sret` so the app
  actually runs. Revisit if a future app needs `core::fmt` or a real
  `memcpy` in `.utext` (that is a local `#[no_mangle]` in `usys`,
  not a link to `compiler_builtins`).

## D-0052: T3.10 handshake only; no RST on FIN or a second 4-tuple
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: superseded in part by D-0053
- **Decision:** T3.10 implements LISTEN → SYN_RCVD → ESTABLISHED and
  nothing past that. One listener (guest port 80), one TCB. Duplicate
  SYN in SYN_RCVD re-sends the same SYN/ACK (same ISN). Payload, FIN,
  RST, and a SYN from a second 4-tuple are **dropped with a counter,
  not RST**. Empty ARP cache on a SYN is the same drop (no panic,
  no ARP-and-queue). D-0041's RST-on-unexpected and the close
  sequence land at T3.11.
- **Alternatives considered:** RST every unexpected segment as D-0041
  already says (rejected at this checkpoint: the hostfwd watcher
  `close()`s after `connect()`, slirp sends FIN, and a second
  hostfwd connect is a second 4-tuple; an honest RST would fail the
  T3.10 "no RST" pcap gate without testing close). Queue a second
  SYN until the first TCB is free (rejected: one connection, no
  timer, and T3.11 is when close exists). Panic on a SYN before the
  gateway MAC is cached (rejected: D-0040, remote bytes never panic).
- **Rationale:** the acceptance is a standalone handshake: SYN →
  SYN/ACK → ACK, ESTABLISHED set, no RST. The harness that makes
  slirp ARP (D-0046) is also the harness that completes the
  handshake; it must not be rewritten to hide FINs. Dropping
  unexpected segments keeps the capture honest for this checkpoint
  without pretending close is implemented.
- **Consequences:** `just test-net-init` fires one hostfwd connect after
  the gateway MAC is learned (D-0046 / D-0054).
  `just test` does not use the watcher. `busy` / `unexpected` in `tcp_drop` may be non-zero on a happy
  boot (second SYN, peer FIN after ESTABLISHED). Malformed counters
  (`short`, `doff`, `csum`, `opt`) must read 0. `drop_proto` must
  read 0 (D-0049). T3.11 (D-0053) implements FIN consumption and
  close. A second 4-tuple is still dropped, not queued and not RST:
  that is one TCB, not a second connection.

## D-0053: One-shot HTTP/1.0, Connection: close, one-segment request
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** T3.11 serves one GET. The app parses a request line in
  the **one segment `recv` returned** (no kernel reassembly, no
  cross-segment buffer). `send` of a fixed `HTTP/1.0 200 OK` body
  with `Connection: close` and the FIN flag is the only data TX and
  the only close the app issues. Stop-and-wait: at most one unacked
  segment; 200 ms `rdtime` RTO from the `recv` poll loop; 8 attempts
  then RST. FIN consumes a sequence number on send (`snd_nxt +=
  len + 1`) and on receive (`rcv_nxt += len + 1`). Close states:
  FIN_WAIT_1 → FIN_WAIT_2 → truncated TIME_WAIT (log, LISTEN);
  CLOSE_WAIT → LAST_ACK when the peer FINs first. An unused TCB
  (no payload delivered to `recv`, no `send`) that sees peer FIN is
  closed by the kernel (FIN+ACK) so LISTEN is restored — that is
  the hostfwd probe, not keep-alive. A second 4-tuple SYN is
  dropped (`busy`), not queued and not RST. The `tcp-drop-first-tx`
  selftest **posts the first data segment** (so the capture has it)
  and **ignores ACKs until one RTO retransmit**; lossless slirp
  would otherwise ACK immediately and hide the timer. While those
  ACKs are held, a peer FIN is also deferred: ACKing the close first
  lets slirp CLOSED and the RTO copy meets RST instead of an ACK.
  The tripwire (D-0037) applies the moment curl has its 200: no
  second `send`, no second TCB, no header-driven keep-alive.
- **Alternatives considered:** reassemble a request line across
  segments (rejected: curl's GET is one segment; a buffer is the
  start of a real HTTP parser and the tripwire forbids it). RST a
  second 4-tuple (rejected: the hostfwd watcher shares the pcap;
  an RST there fails "no RST on the happy path" without proving
  multi-connection). Drop the first TX from the virtio ring
  (rejected: the capture would contain one copy, not two). Full
  TIME_WAIT (rejected: D-0041; a retransmitted peer FIN after we
  are LISTEN meets RST, visible, harmless).
- **Rationale:** the demo is one GET, one response, one FIN pair.
  Everything else is a door D-0037 says not to walk through.
- **Consequences:** the exact body is `whimbrel\n` (9 bytes,
  `Content-Length: 9`). T3.12 flips `just test` to `M3 UNIKERNEL OK`.
  `just test-net-http` is the curl checkpoint; `just test-net-rto` is
  the timer checkpoint. `http-persist` (T3.12) recycles LISTEN after
  close so `just run-http` can serve sequential Connection: close
  connections; it is not keep-alive and still one TCB.
  `recv` returns 0 only after the peer FIN **and** our inflight
  segment is ACKed — otherwise the app would `exit` before the RTO
  could fire. Truncated TIME_WAIT does not clear that EOF. A late
  FIN after LISTEN is dropped, not RST, so the happy-path capture
  stays RST-free (the hostfwd watcher and a retransmitted peer FIN
  share that pcap).

## D-0054: ARP for the gateway at init; do not wait to be asked
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** `net::init` transmits an ARP request for `10.0.2.2` and
  waits for the reply. That populates the cache D-0047 panics on. The
  kernel no longer waits to be ARPed by slirp (the ~2 s `wait_rx_arp`
  that panics on a standalone boot). We still answer a request for our
  IP if one arrives. GARP still goes out after the cache is filled.
- **Alternatives considered:** keep the hostfwd watcher as a boot
  dependency (rejected: M4 measurement runs and `just run-http` have no
  watcher; a demo that panics without an external connect is not a
  unikernel). Hard-code slirp's MAC (rejected: D-0047 — the cache would
  be ornamental). ARP-and-queue on the first IPv4 TX (rejected: still
  D-0047; init is the one place we may wait).
- **Rationale:** being asked is a harness accident, not a protocol
  requirement. An ARP client is the missing half of RFC 826 and the
  only way D-0047's empty-cache panic means "resolution failed" rather
  than "nobody poked hostfwd in time".
- **Consequences:** `just run-http` boots to LISTEN with nothing else
  running. The T3.5/T3.6 "slirp ARPs us first" pcap chain is no longer
  the default-boot story; the live assert is our request then slirp's
  reply (`assert-pcap-gateway-arp.sh`). D-0046's watcher remains for the
  `net-init-selftest` handshake sibling only, and fires after the cache
  is filled rather than after `TX ARP reply`. D-0047 is amended: the
  panic is a real miss.

## D-0055: M4 methodology frozen before any optimization
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted (turbo-off override 2026-08-17)
-   **Decision:** the benchmark protocol is fixed now and every M4 number
  obeys it. Per (system, config) batch: 3 warmup trials marked and
  excluded, 30 recorded trials. Warmup is round-robin across configs;
  recorded trials of every config in a batch are interleaved and
  shuffled so elapsed-time drift hits both arms. Statistics: median and IQR for every
  comparison and before/after claim; minimum shown alongside as the
  observed floor bound; means never. Host controls: one host machine for
  all report numbers, performance governor, `taskset`-pinned QEMU and
  client on separate cores; recorded per batch: QEMU version + binary
  hash, whimbrel git SHA + dirty flag, host kernel, CPU model, governor,
  1-minute load average. Pinning is enforced fail-loudly: the harness
  refuses to aggregate rows with mismatched QEMU version or a dirty
  working tree. Data shape: long/tidy CSV — `results/runs.csv` (one row
  per trial: identity, host metadata, E0-anchored edges, client attempt
  count, pcap path) and `results/phases.csv` (one row per trial × phase:
  ticks, ns since E2, delta, source); a summarizer emits
  n/median/IQR/min/max; report tables are generated from CSV by script,
  never typed. Phase data reaches the dataset by parsing the existing
  machine-shaped `PHASE` serial lines; a line that fails to parse fails
  the batch. The measurement client is a persistent process stamping a
  monotonic clock at ~1 ms cadence (audit finding 32 retires the
  fork-per-attempt curl loop); its measured granularity is reported.
  **Stability criterion (the T4.1 finish line):** two interleaved
  30-trial batches whose per-metric medians agree within max(2%, 200 µs)
  for every metric ≥ 1 ms. This is batch 1 vs batch 2, not safe vs fast
  inside one batch. **No optimization work until that criterion
  holds and the baseline is frozen at a recorded SHA.** Pre-baseline
  corrections (D-0056) and instrumentation (D-0057) are exempt from the
  no-optimization rule, never from the gate list.
- **Alternatives considered:** wide CSV, one column per phase (rejected:
  every new stamp is a schema migration; long format makes T4.2 additive).
  Minimum as the headline statistic — theoretically closest to a floor
  under one-sided noise (rejected for comparisons: an order statistic
  improves with N and is unfair across systems with different noise
  profiles; kept as the shown floor bound).   Mean/stddev (rejected: one
  descheduled run poisons a mean invisibly). Deeper host surgery —
  isolcpus, turbo off (rejected *for gates and for the original
  runs-anywhere host*: breaks that property; `taskset` plus N trials
  plus recorded load average covers what those claims need). **Overridden
  for the dedicated host only — see Consequences.** Record-and-warn on
  QEMU mismatch (rejected: a
  mixed-version CSV is silent corruption; fail loudly is the house rule).
  `-icount` for determinism (already rejected in D-0043).
- **Rationale:** every before/after claim in the report is only as real
  as its "before". A numeric stability criterion makes "the harness is
  ready" a fact instead of a feeling, and it is also the tripwire that
  catches audit finding 12's predicted tick-quantization variance — if
  the criterion fails, the investigation is methodology work with a
  finding at the end, not a reason to lower the bar.
- **Consequences:** trials are ~2–3 s wall, so 30+3 per config is cheap;
  the QEMU invocation is already quadruplicated (audit finding 28) and
  the harness must source a single shared definition rather than become
  a fifth copy. `just bench` regenerating every cited number is the
  milestone acceptance test. Finding 14 (`-C force-frame-pointers=yes`
  in the measured build) is settled inside T4.1 with one A/B batch:
  strip it if the delta clears the stability floor, else record it as a
  stated condition — either way with the number in hand.
  **T4.1 implementation:** `scripts/qemu-args.sh` is the shared QEMU argv
  (boot-test, justfile, bench); `scripts/bench.sh` writes long/tidy
  `results/runs.csv` and `results/phases.csv`. The summarizer refuses
  dirty trees and mixed QEMU/git SHA. **Finding 14 A/B (release+fast-boot,
  N=30 recorded, git `9871d87`, QEMU 8.2.2):** E2→E3g median with
  `-C force-frame-pointers=yes` is 31.062 ms, without is 30.812 ms,
  Δ = +0.250 ms (FP slower). E0→E4 Δ = +0.078 ms. Both sit inside
  max(2%, 200 µs). The operator chose strip (see Finding 14 strip
  below). **Stability criterion (two consecutive
  30-trial batches, git `356b37a`):** not met. release-default shifted
  systematically slower on batch 2 (E2→E3g 98.5 → 105.6 ms; paging,
  DRIVER_OK, listen, freeze, first_rx all moved). release-fast-boot's
  guest-internal phases stayed inside the bar; its E0-anchored edges
  missed by a little (E0→E4 74.0 → 75.6 ms; first-connect 17.58 →
  18.08 ms). The criterion is not widened. Client granularity median
  1.000232 ms (C1; curl was 5–15 ms).
  **Finding 14 strip:** both A/B deltas sat inside the floor, but `.text`
  dropped ~15% (0xc32c → 0xaa1c) and image size is a reported metric.
  `-C force-frame-pointers=yes` is removed from `.cargo/config.toml`
  (release / measured path). Debug re-adds it by merging
  `scripts/cargo-debug.sh` (`just build`, `just debug`, `boot-test.sh`
  PROFILE=debug) so GDB backtraces still work. `RUSTFLAGS` is not used:
  it replaces linker.ld.
  **Batch-order confound:** the first T4.1 pair ran configs as sequential
  blocks and batch 2 always after batch 1, so monotonic host drift reads
  as a systematic batch difference. Recorded trials are now interleaved
  within a batch and shuffled (`shuffle_seed` on every run row; warmup is
  round-robin, 3 per config, then the shuffled recorded schedule).
  **Stability under interleaving:** the criterion still compares **two
  interleaved batches** (batch 1 vs batch 2 per-metric medians, same
  N=30 recorded per config, same max(2%, 200 µs) bar). It is not a
  within-batch comparison of the two arms — default vs fast-boot is the
  treatment contrast and is supposed to differ. The bar is not widened.
  **Steal:** each trial records `/proc/stat` aggregate steal delta
  (`steal_ticks`, `steal_ns`). USER_HZ=100 ⇒ 10 ms/tick, coarser than
  the 200 µs floor and coarser than the first miss (E0→E4 Δ 1.64 ms).
  Steal is diagnostic, not a stability metric.
  **Fresh interleaved pair (git `9678270`, shuffle_seed
  `1786876111394580533`, QEMU 8.2.2, N=30×2 configs×2 batches):** steal
  was 0 on 119/120 recorded trials and 1 tick on one fast-boot trial
  (E0→E4 78.6 ms, not the slowest). Spearman(steal, E0→E4) = −0.017;
  the slow quartile's mean steal was 0. Steal does not explain the slow
  trials. `/proc/stat` steal is the wrong instrument for sub-tick
  jitter. release-default now **passes** batch 1 vs 2 (E2→E3g 106.130 vs
  106.676 ms) — the old 98.5 → 105.6 ms shift was the batch-order
  confound. release-fast-boot still **fails** on the host-side edge only:
  E0→E4 75.509 → 77.292 ms (Δ 1.78 ms, tol 1.55 ms); guest E2→E3g
  30.831 → 30.949 ms stays inside the bar. Spearman(run_order, E0→E4)
  = 0.55 on fast-boot: wall-clock drift remains, and the 2% bar is
  tighter on the shorter arm (~1.55 ms vs ~3.0 ms on default). The
  criterion is not widened. This host is a 4-CPU KVM guest (`hypervisor`,
  `systemd-detect-virt=kvm`, cgroup `pod-…`) with no cpufreq and a
  generic `Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor` CPUID; D-0055's performance
  governor is `unavailable`. Cumulative steal is nonzero (203 ticks at
  diagnosis start) but almost never lands inside a 2 s trial. Report-grade
  numbers are not obtainable here; the bench host has to be dedicated.
  **Dedicated host (after T4.1 diagnosis):** development and correctness
  gates run anywhere. Every report number comes from a dedicated Ubuntu
  machine whose spec block lives in the report (SETUP.md § dedicated
  measurement host). Required, and **fail-closed** in `scripts/bench.py`
  before a report-grade batch — missing evidence is a fail, not a skip:
  `systemd-detect-virt` = `none`, cpufreq present, every online CPU on
  the performance governor, SMT off, turbo/boost off, steal 0 on every
  trial in the batch. The original alternative that rejected turbo-off
  still holds for gates and for any machine that is not this host; it
  does not hold for report numbers.
  **Turbo-off override (dedicated host):** boost off costs ~17% peak
  clock on the provisioned 7800X3D (4.2 GHz vs 5.05 GHz), so absolute
  numbers are larger — TCG is host-bound. Boost-state and thermal
  variance are removed, which is what the stability criterion measures.
  Every compared system runs on this same host under the same boost-off
  policy, so comparisons are unaffected; only the absolute floor moves.
  Host-control asserts (virt / governor / SMT / boost / steal,
  fail-closed, all five recorded in `runs.csv`) landed from the
  dedicated-host tree (`acb226c`).
  The cloud workspace is a pod on a KVM guest with no cpufreq and cannot
  meet this entry's host controls.
  **Harness findings that survive the move:** (1) per-trial `/proc/stat`
  steal at USER_HZ=100 cannot resolve millisecond misses — steal=0 is
  necessary, not sufficient. (2) Interleaving configs and shuffling
  recorded trials fixed a batch-order confound that had looked like a
  guest-internal shift (release-default E2→E3g 98.5 → 105.6 ms under
  sequential blocks; the same contrast passed once trials were mixed).
  **T4.3 freeze (report-grade baseline):** the stability criterion
  passed on both configs on the dedicated host — the first data that
  counts. Tag `baseline-t4.3` (freeze commit `bce55a2` that holds the
  CSVs). Measured kernel git SHA
  `35861f30861844e50b4d50a87e67cc96844a14ef`.
  Batches `20260817T041311Z-1` and `20260817T041311Z-2`. N=30 recorded
  + 3 warmup per config per batch, two interleaved batches, steal 0
  on all 120 recorded trials. CSVs: `results/runs.csv`,
  `results/phases.csv`, `results/baseline-summary.txt`. Machine-spec
  block, verbatim from the harness summary header:

  **Every subsequent before/after claim cites this baseline.** The

- **Methodology amendment (2026-08-20, from D-0080's first execution —
  an instrument that sampled 1000× off its registered cadence while
  every gate it had passed):** every registered quantitative design
  parameter — cadence, duration, trial counts, window span,
  thresholds, exclusion sets — must be either **enforced fail-closed
  by the instrument at run time** or **computed from the recorded
  data and gated at analysis time**. Never asserted as prose, never
  printed as static text a reader could mistake for a measurement. A
  registration whose parameter exists only in prose must say so, in
  the registration ("stated, unenforced"). Self-tests are fail-open
  unless they contain an input representing the failure mode and
  assert the gate refuses it — the same shape as audit finding 31: a
  broken build must FAIL every gate. Incident record and the first
  audit of the live registrations against this rule: D-0080, first
  execution (2026-08-20).

## D-0056: Pre-baseline corrections (T4.0b)
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** four audit findings are fixed before the first baseline
  batch, because each changes what the baseline would mean.
  1. **Fail-closed harness (finding 31):** `scripts/boot-test.sh` runs
     under `set -euo pipefail` from line 1, with deliberate `set +e`
     islands only where exit codes are inspected. The build-failure mode
     is exercised once (DEBUGGING.md §4 item 8: an untested failure mode
     is an unwritten assert) — a broken `cargo build` must yield FAIL on
     every gate, never a stale-kernel PASS.
  2. **E3g at publish (finding 9):** the E3g stamp moves between
     `post_tx` (descriptor publish — D-0043's definition) and
     `virtq::notify`. A second stamp `E3g_doorbell` lands after the
     notify store returns. Under TCG the doorbell runs the device model
     synchronously, so E3g_doorbell − E3g prices the device handoff as
     its own measured line instead of silently inflating E3g and
     distorting E3w − E3g.
  3. **Spin, don't `wfi`, in boot RX waits (finding 12):** the `wfi`s in
     `wait_gateway_arp` and `wait_ping_reply` are removed in all
     profiles — one code path (D-0014). This un-quantizes ARP/ping
     latency from the 10 ms tick. **Recorded corollary (finding 13):
     those `wfi`s made timer ticks load-bearing for boot progress — with
     no tick armed, the first `wfi` with nothing pending halts forever,
     ahead of the timeout check. Any future rung that removes tick
     arming from fast-boot is legal only because this entry removed the
     sleeps first.**
  4. **Buffer sizes by construction (finding 36):** the app crate exports
     its recv buffer sizes; the kernel adds `const _` asserts tying them
     to `tcp::PAYLOAD_MAX` and `net::UDP_PAYLOAD_MAX`, and the UDP
     image's buffer grows to match. `recv`'s
     copy-then-consume-everything shape stays; what changes is that
     silent truncation stops being representable.
- **Alternatives considered:** measuring first and fixing after
  (rejected: a baseline with a fail-open harness, a mislabeled E3g, and
  tick-quantized waits is a "before" the report would have to disown).
  Fast-boot-only spins with `wfi` kept in the default profile (rejected:
  two code paths for one loop, and the safe/fast delta would then mix a
  power idiom into the price-of-paranoia line). Moving E3g without
  keeping a doorbell stamp (rejected: the synchronous handoff is exactly
  the kind of term floor-finding wants measured, and it is free to keep).
- **Rationale:** these are corrections to the instruments, not
  optimizations of the apparatus — the distinction D-0055 draws. Each was
  found by reading code the gates already passed, which is the audit's
  point: green gates and zero warnings do not certify that a label tells
  the truth.
- **Consequences:** the spin change costs host CPU during two boot waits
  (bounded by the same 2 s timeouts; D-0040 already accepted that
  polling is free at this workload). The stamp addition touches the
  triplicated justfile phase lists (finding 26) in the same commit.
  `E3g` keeps its name and its D-0043 definition; every prior chat-level
  E3g number predates the harness and dies under the report rule anyway.

## D-0057: Attribution stamps and phase renames (T4.2)
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the phase set becomes the audit's decomposition,
  verbatim. New stamps: `frame_init` (after `frame::init`; check_dtb
  rides with it), `task_init`, `page_build`, `page_verify`, `activate`
  (the `satp` switch — finding 3 named this remainder `paging`; the T4.2
  landing names it `activate` so the old composite cannot hide behind
  the same word), `virtq_init` (splitting the
  doubled program+verify out of DRIVER_OK, finding 4), `serving_ready`
  (gateway MAC learned — the true earliest-serve point, finding 6),
  `heap_init` and `accounting` (splitting the freeze delta, finding 7),
  `syn_rx` and `established` (splitting client arrival out of the E3g
  tail, finding 9). Renames: `listen` → `net_init_done` (finding 6).
  Stamp overhead is measured by two adjacent stamps at boot (`stamp_a`,
  `stamp_b`) and reported with the table; every attributed delta is
  quoted against that floor. Phase deltas from `_start` through `E3g`
  must sum to E2→E3g within that floor (harness fail-closed, not a
  visual check). The audit's finding-10 cost inventory and finding-12
  variance prediction were **pre-registered claims**: T4.2's first
  attributed table is checked against both, and agreement or
  disagreement is recorded in the report draft — if they disagree, one
  of them is wrong and that is a result, not an embarrassment. Finding
  12's disagreement is overtaken-by-fix (D-0056.3), not a wrong
  mechanism; both that outcome and finding 10's item-by-item score go
  in the report (`docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`).
- **Alternatives considered:** keeping the nine-stamp set and attributing
  by code reading alone (rejected: FREEZE already proved labels lie
  while gates stay green). Perf-style sampling under TCG (rejected:
  wrong tool for a 40 ms boot in an emulator; stamps at 100 ns
  resolution are the native instrument). Renaming `E3g` (rejected:
  D-0043 fixed its meaning; D-0056 moved the stamp to match the name).
- **Rationale:** rung attribution is impossible while "paging" contains
  four unrelated costs; every ladder decision downstream keys off this
  table. Instrumentation precedes the baseline freeze because a frozen
  baseline without attribution would have to be re-frozen immediately.
- **Consequences (the co-edit checklist, audit finding 26):** T4.2
  touched `src/phase.rs` (N=22, index consts, NAMES) and collapsed the
  three justfile HTTP greps onto one `phase_names` variable. They can
  collapse that far — the three loops were identical — but they cannot
  merge with `phase::NAMES` without a generator (Rust consts vs shell).
  The harness still parses names from serial and is not a fourth copy.
  A stamp that is legitimately unset in some image must be exempted per
  image, not grepped away. Phase names are frozen after T4.2 so
  `phases.csv` rows stay comparable across the whole ladder.
  **T4.2 landing (this host, ladder ordering only — not a results
  table, not a report number):** one boot each of debug-default,
  debug-fast-boot, release-default, release-fast-boot. Stamp overhead
  (`stamp_b` − `stamp_a`) was 6.8 µs / 7.0 µs on release and 27.6 µs /
  34.2 µs on debug. Phase deltas summed to E2→E3g within that floor.
  Finding 10 vs **release+fast-boot** (the inventory's path), quoted
  against the 6.8 µs floor:
  - **Right class:** `frame_init` is ms (here 93 ms, list-build dominates
    the old "paging" blob); `page_build` 1.4 ms and `page_verify` 2.2 ms
    are both ms, verify ≥ build; `accounting` 5.1 ms (inventory ~6 ms);
    `freeze` itself is 11 µs under fast-boot (the bool store); `heap_init`
    is trivial (30 µs); `sret` is 30 µs; `ping_gateway` is ms on the safe
    profile (`net_init_done` 6.1 ms) once it is not overlapped by an
    early client.
  - **Wrong class / mixed:** `task_init` is 0.89 ms, not µs; `virtq_init`
    first pass is 1.0 ms, not tens of µs; `stvec` (DBCN + CSR + install)
    is 0.29 ms, not µs. Those three share a direction — predicted µs,
    measured sub-ms — a systematic bias in the audit's cost estimates,
    and an observation about pre-registration itself. `timer::init`
    rides inside `frame_init` (the inventory's tick-trap cost is not its
    own line; fast-boot also skips the tick-3 wait). `ping_gateway` is
    **not** ms under CLIENT_EARLY fast-boot: `syn_rx` lands during the
    ARP/ping wait, so the diagnostic RTT is overlapped (finding 6). HTTP
    READY's 11 DBCN ecalls are not a visible E3g-tail line when the
    client is early — `established`→`E3g` is 1.7 ms of serve, not
    console.
  - **Finding 6 confirmed:** on CLIENT_EARLY, `syn_rx` and `established`
    fire before `serving_ready` / `net_init_done`. TCP was serving during
    the ping wait; `listen` was the wrong name twice.
  - **Finding 12 refuted here, overtaken by a fix:** `first_rx` is
    0.60 ms on this boot, not a 10 ms tick-wide IQR. D-0056.3 already
    removed `wfi` in `wait_gateway_arp` / `wait_ping_reply`, so T4.2
    never saw the quantization the audit predicted. The mechanism was
    real at `4660fab`; the prediction was not simply wrong. Report both.
  - **Safe-profile leftover:** without fast-boot, `freeze` is still 6.3 ms
    because `freeze()`'s `free_count()` println argument is evaluated —
    a second walk after `accounting`. Finding 7 called that out for
    fast-boot only. Fast-boot compiles the print out (`println!` →
    `print!` cfg), so only the accounting walk is on the measured path.
    D-0060's O(1) `free_count` therefore collapses **two** walks on the
    safe profile, not one.
  Debug paging is still opt-level=0 (page_build+verify 81 ms fast / 103 ms
  default on this boot), not the cost of paging, and must not migrate into
  a results table (finding 20). **Ladder order after this table:**
  `frame_init` first (free-list build ~93 ms dwarfs everything; not
  paging), then `accounting`, then `page_verify`. Superpages (D-0059)
  re-evaluated once `page_build`+`page_verify` (3.6 ms combined on this
  boot) is a larger share of what remains. Magnitudes are this noisy
  KVM pod; the dedicated host re-measures. No rung starts until that
  baseline exists (D-0055).

## D-0058: Optimization-ladder governance
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** rungs land one at a time, each as: hypothesis → expected
  gain from the attributed table → land with its co-edit list → full
  gate list green → N-trial safe+fast regeneration → ladder row in the
  draft (before/after medians, IQR, min) → one commit. **A rung is
  eligible only if its attributed projected gain is ≥ 5% of the current
  E2→E3g median**; below that it is declined-with-reason in the ladder
  table. **Planned order (amended 2026-08-17 after the T4.3 freeze):**
  next is bump-pointer / lazy free-list (`frame_init`; the pre-T4.2
  "rung 3" candidate; T4.2 already moved it first because the free-list
  build — not paging — is the dominant kernel term). That representation
  **subsumes** D-0060. `free_count()` is expensive today because the
  free list *is* the ~31k virgin frames; a bump records virgin remainder
  as `(RAM_END − bump) / PAGE_SIZE`, and the intrusive list holds only
  recycled frames (empty or tiny at freeze). Leaving the walk in place
  after the change would be wrong, not free — it would count recycled
  nodes only, and the frames-consumed assert would fire. Rewriting
  `free_count()` to bump arithmetic is a co-edit of the bump rung, not a
  second rung. D-0060 (allocated counter on the current intrusive list)
  is **declined-by-subsumption**: it would collapse `accounting` and
  leave `frame_init` at 7.20 ms; the bump does both. T4.4 records the
  bump design (and the D-0019 amendment) in its own entry before code.
  After bump: superpages (D-0059) if `page_build`+`page_verify` clears
  the 5% bar against the new denominator — T4.4 measured 3.84 ms = 42%
  of 9.17 ms, so they were next. T4.6 measured them: paging 1.12 ms,
  E2→E3g 6.43 ms. `page_verify` as a delete-the-pass rung stays
  rejected (D-0043).
  **`virtq_init` candidate (finding 4):** the first program+verify pass,
  wiped by `net::init`'s reset. Against the freeze it was 850.5 µs =
  4.0% of 21.42 ms and did **not** clear 5%. After T4.4 it is 845.4 µs
  = 9% of 9.17 ms (5% bar 458 µs). After superpages it is 842 µs =
  13% of 6.43 ms (5% bar 322 µs) and **remains eligible**. It is
  **not** bundled with `DRIVER_OK` (543 µs): that sibling is the live
  pass, structurally necessary; summing to manufacture a larger
  percentage would count work we are not removing. `fill_descriptors`
  stays, so 842 µs is a ceiling on the gain. The bar is 5% of the
  *current* median. Sequencing after T4.6: D-0068 (dump placement)
  landed and was measured — occupancy not confirmed; yield kept.
  The Linux baseline takes the honest number with E3w→E4 stated
  open; virtq_init stays recorded-eligible, not the next action
  (see D-0069 / the T4.6 ladder read). The floor is **not** declared:
  one candidate still clears 5% of E2→E3g.
  Further residue, still data-driven: `ping_gateway` gated out of
  fast-boot (needs its own decision entry: wire behavior changes; ARP
  wait and GARP stay in all profiles), tick arming under fast-boot
  (legal only after D-0056.3; co-edits the `tick 3` gate), E3g-tail work
  only if `syn_rx`→`E3g` shows kernel time worth the risk. No rung lands
  until the dedicated host freezes a baseline (D-0055; that freeze is
  `baseline-t4.3`). The ladder closes when no remaining candidate
  clears the bar — that closure is the floor declaration the report
  cites.
  **Declined now, recorded so the report can say why:** D-0060
  (subsumed by bump/lazy); DBCN buffer-write FID 0 (nothing prints on
  the measured path); interrupt-driven networking (D-0040's boot-cost
  argument is a boot benchmark's argument); Sstc under `-bios default`
  (unprobeable, D-0018 — it exists only inside D-0061's variant).
  `virtq_init` was declined-below-bar *against the freeze*; T4.4
  re-evaluated it above the bar. The T4.3b audit cleanup (findings
  33–35, 37–39) is not a rung: it lands after the baseline freeze
  precisely because it must not move any number.
- **Alternatives considered:** batching rungs for fewer measurement
  cycles (rejected: un-attributable regressions; one rung, one row is
  the whole point). A time budget per rung (rejected: calendar-shaped;
  the 5% bar is the returns-shaped equivalent). Optimizing the safe
  profile too (rejected: the safe build is the control; it changes only
  when correctness demands). Keeping the pre-T4.2 order (accounting,
  then superpages, then bump-hybrid) after attribution showed
  `frame_init` ~93 ms (rejected: the 5% bar would have been theater).
  Doing D-0060 first, then bump (rejected 2026-08-17: bump subsumes
  the walk; a counter on the current list is a smaller independent
  rung that the larger representation change makes unnecessary).
  Bundling `virtq_init` with `DRIVER_OK` to clear 5% (rejected: the
  bar is gain; `DRIVER_OK` is not removable).
- **Rationale:** the ladder's product is the before/after table, and the
  table is only evidence if every row shares the same frozen protocol.
  The 5% bar operationalizes "diminishing returns" so the open-ended
  runway cannot become an unfinished ladder. Attribution is allowed to
  reorder the plan; that is what T4.2 was for.
- **Consequences:** the safe−fast per-phase delta (price of paranoia) is
  recomputed at every rung; the D-0043 promise that verification cost
  survives as its own line is kept by construction. Expected arc, stated
  as an estimate and not a claim: bump/lazy collapsed `frame_init` and,
  by the same representation, `accounting` (and the safe profile's
  second freeze walk); superpages (D-0059) took paging from 42% of
  9.17 ms to 1.12 ms of 6.43 ms. `virtq_init` still clears 5% of
  E2→E3g (842 µs / 6.43 ms). After T4.6 the honest number is
  dominated by firmware (~24 ms class) and E3w→E4 (D-0066 / D-0068);
  D-0061 is the firmware candidate by the ladder's own rule. The
  next *action* is the Linux baseline, not another E2→E3g rung.
  E3w→E4 was open when this was written; D-0070/D-0071 later
  resolved it as a mislabeling (QEMU startup + guest boot wait),
  not a host term a rung could take.

## D-0059: 2 MiB superpages for the RAM interior (amends D-0026)
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted (measured 2026-08-17; batches
  `20260817T061753Z-1`/`-2`, git_sha `76830e13`, n=60, steal 0,
  stability PASS both configs)
- **Decision:** the identity map goes mixed-granularity. 4 KiB leaves
  stay for everything the map distinguishes at 4 KiB grain: kernel image
  W^X regions, guard holes, user sections, task-slot stacks and break
  windows, and the virtio-mmio window. The aligned interior of the big
  R+W RAM range becomes 2 MiB level-1 leaves, with 4 KiB fragments from
  the fine-grained region's end up to the first 2 MiB boundary. A new
  `map_2m` panics on misaligned VA/PA (concept: a superpage PPN with
  nonzero low bits is a hardware fault, D-0026's recorded failure mode).
  The software walker and every verifier become level-aware: each region
  carries an *expected leaf level*, RAM-interior probes must resolve at
  L1 with aligned PPN, everything else at L0, and the wrong level is a
  panic, not a pass. The cliff-specific `require_leaf` probes
  (post-`satp` PC, `__trap_entry`, live `sp`) stay in 4 KiB regions and
  do not change.
  **Load-bearing (named failed co-edit, not a mysterious half-gain):**
  `map_range` and `assert_range` currently step `PAGE_SIZE` (`src/page.rs`
  `:187-195`, `:515-555`). They must step by the leaf grain they just
  installed. A mapper that plants L1 leaves while the verifier still
  walks every 4 KiB VA still does ~32k iterations (only shorter); that
  is not the intended rung. Virtio `require_identity_rw*` stays L0
  because the pool lives in `.bss`.
- **Alternatives considered:** 1 GiB leaves (still rejected, D-0026's
  original reason: one PTE would span OpenSBI, guards, and every W^X
  boundary). Keeping 4 KiB everywhere and only fixing the walk cost with
  a faster loop (rejected: the cost is the ~32k-entry structure itself —
  build and verify are both linear in leaves). Dropping the verify pass
  under fast-boot instead (rejected: D-0043 keeps verify deliberately;
  shrinking its cost by shrinking the structure preserves the
  price-of-paranoia finding instead of deleting it).
- **Rationale:** D-0026 said revisit "only with an explicit alignment
  check on the leaf PPN" — this entry is that revisit, with the check in
  both the mapper and the verifier. Pre-T4.2, page_build + page_verify
  were expected to be the dominant kernel term. T4.2 showed they sat
  behind `frame_init` and `accounting`. T4.4 collapsed those two; the
  pair is now 3.84 ms = 42% of fast E2→E3g 9.17 ms, which is the
  re-evaluation condition this entry set. Leaf count drops from ~32k
  to a few hundred, and verification cost scales down with it —
  measured twice, before and after, which is itself a result about
  what verification costs are made of.
- **Consequences — projected gain, pre-registered 2026-08-17 against
  T4.4 (`HEAD` batches `20260817T052349Z-*`, n=60) before any kernel
  edit. Ranges, not optimistic bounds: T4.4 leftover point estimates
  were ~40% optimistic (D-0065 outcome; audit finding 10 is the first
  data point on the same bias).**
  Leaf-count estimate from T4.4 exhaust `total=31823` → `__heap_end` ≈
  `0x803B1000`: 62 × 2 MiB leaves on `0x80400000..0x88000000`; ~520
  4 KiB leaves for `0x80200000..0x80400000` (W^X, guards, user/task,
  heap, alignment fragment) plus eight virtio-mmio pages;
  `tables_used` 67 → 5–8 (root + RAM L1 + one L0 for
  `0x80200000..0x80400000` + MMIO L1 + MMIO L0, with slack for an
  extra fragment table).
  - `page_verify` 2.39 ms → **80–400 µs** if grain-correct. **1.5–2.2 ms**
    if `assert_range` still steps 4 KiB against L1 leaves (failed
    co-edit; walk count did not shrink). Falsified if the median stays
    **≥ 1.0 ms** (the walk did not shrink) or drops **< 30 µs** (a
    third thing vanished).
  - `page_build` 1.45 ms → **50–300 µs**. Falsified if **≥ 0.8 ms**.
  - Combined paging 3.84 ms → **0.15–0.70 ms**. Fast E2→E3g 9.17 ms →
    **5.5–8.0 ms** (arithmetic remainder if only paging moves is
    ~5.5–6.0 ms; the registered range leaves room for the documented
    estimate bias and for cache/TLB secondaries of the kind T4.4
    showed). Falsified if still **> 8.5 ms**, or if a phase this
    hypothesis does not name vanishes.
  - `tables_used` 67 → **5–8**. Falsified if still 67.
- **Consequences — the co-edit checklist (audit findings 24/25/27); every
  item is walked in the same change or the rung does not merge:**
  1. `src/task.rs` frames-consumed assert: `tables != 67` and the
     leftover split (finding 24) — recompute and update deliberately.
     `held = tables + leftover` still holds; the 67 is what moves.
  2. `src/page.rs` doc comment deriving 67 (`:113-119`).
  3. `walk()`'s superpage panic citing D-0026 (`:356-361`) — becomes the
     level-aware acceptance path. Wrong level remains a panic.
  4. `map_range` 4 KiB stepping (`:187-195`) and `assert_range`
     `level == 0` plus 4 KiB stepping (`:515-555`) — per-region expected
     level **and** grain. `require_leaf` L0-only (`:720`) stays L0 for
     the cliff probes (those VAs remain 4 KiB regions).
  5. `virtq` pool verification through `require_identity_rw*`
     (`src/virtq.rs:305-341,359`) — the pool lives in `.bss` (4 KiB
     region) and must still verify at L0.
  6. D-0036's "69 frames (67 tables + 2)" amendment and D-0039's
     "tables_used is 67" consequence — prose updated with the new
     derivation.
  7. justfile probe-format greps (`:92-97`) if the printed row format
     grows a level column (finding 27). Prefer keeping the virtio lo/hi
     row format so those greps do not move.
  8. DEBUGGING.md gains the superpage first-response note (`info mem`
     cross-check; misaligned-superpage signature).
- **Consequences — checklist walk (landed 2026-08-17):** every item
  above is in this change. (1) `task::enter` uses `EXPECTED_TABLES`
  (5) and `held == tables + leftover`. (2) `EXPECTED_TABLES` derivation
  is the module comment; `page::init` panics if `tables_used()`
  disagrees. (3) `walk()` accepts aligned L1 leaves and still panics
  on 1 GiB and on a 2 MiB PPN with nonzero low bits. (4) `map_range_2m`
  / `assert_range` step by leaf grain; `require_leaf` stays L0. (5)
  virtq `require_identity_rw*` untouched (pool in `.bss`). (6) D-0036
  and D-0039 prose use 5 tables / 7 held. (7) virtio lo/hi row format
  unchanged; justfile greps do not move. (8) DEBUGGING.md note added.
  `map_range` (4 KiB) still steps `PAGE_SIZE` for fine-grained
  regions; the named failed co-edit was a 4 KiB-step `assert_range`
  against L1 leaves, which would leave `page_verify` in the 1.5–2.2 ms
  band.
- **Consequences — measured T4.6 (dedicated host, batches
  `20260817T061753Z-1`/`-2`, git_sha `76830e13`, n=60, steal 0,
  stability PASS both configs):**
  | metric | predicted | actual | verdict |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `page_build` | 50–300 µs | 386 µs | over range; falsify-if ≥ 0.8 ms held |
  | `page_verify` | 80–400 µs grain-correct; 1.5–2.2 ms if 4K-stepping | 731 µs | over range; far from the 4K-stepping band; falsify-if ≥ 1.0 ms and < 30 µs held |
  | combined paging | 0.15–0.70 ms | 1.12 ms | over range |
  | fast E2→E3g | 5.5–8.0 ms | 6.43 ms | **in range** |
  | `tables_used` | 5–8 | 5 | hit; L1 leaves resolved |
  Headline: fast E2→E3g 9.17 → 6.43 ms (−30%). Cumulative from
  `baseline-t4.3` 21.42 → 6.43 ms (3.3×). Fast E0→E4 54.52 → 51.67 ms
  (the 2.74 ms paging save showed up on the honest number). Grain-
  correct path confirmed: 731 µs is not the 1.5–2.2 ms failed-co-edit
  band. Arithmetic remainder if only paging moved: 9.17 − (3.84 −
  1.12) = 6.45 ms; actual 6.43 ms. The headline range caught the
  phase-range miss because it padded for D-0069; the phase ranges
  did not pad enough.
  **Estimate bias (D-0069), third data point.** Both paging phases
  overran a range that was already 2–10× a linear-in-leaves
  extrapolation. Linear `page_verify`: 2.39 ms × (~580 / ~32k) ≈
  40 µs; registered 80–400 µs; measured 731 µs (~18× linear).
  Same direction as finding 10 and T4.4 leftovers.
  **`freeze` 7.3 → 12.2 µs (+67%).** `freeze()` is unchanged: one
  `FROZEN` store; the `free_count()` println is not evaluated under
  fast-boot (`src/console.rs` `#[cfg(not(feature = "fast-boot"))]`).
  The frames-consumed assert moved to `EXPECTED_TABLES` but sits
  *before* the accounting stamp, so it is not in this delta. Cause:
  TCG/I-cache secondary of deleting the 32k-iteration verify loop
  that previously ran immediately before accounting+freeze. T4.4's
  secondary was a *warm* data cache after not touching ~125 MiB
  (`page_verify` −7%, `E3g` −13%). This one is the opposite sign
  on a few instructions: the hot `walk()` trace is gone, freeze+stamp
  re-translate. Extra ~5 µs is stamp-overhead class (`stamp_b` is
  5.5 µs). Not a second walk, not a co-edit miss. Named in the
  ladder row so it is not an unexplained change. Not a rung.
- Revisit trigger: none — D-0026's 4-KiB-only rule is superseded for
  the RAM interior and stands everywhere else.

## D-0060: O(1) frame accounting (rung 2)
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: declined-by-subsumption (2026-08-17; D-0065).
  Pre-T4.2 numbering put this first and bump as "rung 3"; T4.2 attribution
  superseded that order (bump first) but still listed this as a separate
  next rung. Never landed. The check is not deleted — D-0065's bump
  arithmetic *is* `free_count()`. A counter on the intrusive list would
  have fixed `accounting` while leaving `frame_init`.
- **Decision (original, not landed):** `alloc_frame` / `free_frame`
  maintain an allocated counter; `free_count()` becomes
  `TOTAL − allocated`, O(1). The `task::enter` frames-consumed assert
  keeps its exact semantics at ~zero cost. The paranoia is not deleted —
  it is made free: the safe build's `frame::self_test` gains a
  cross-check of the counter against a full list walk, so counter drift
  cannot hide, and `stress`'s restored-list assertion keeps a full walk
  on its own path (audit finding 30) so the storm still verifies the
  actual list.
- **Alternatives considered:** deleting the accounting assert (rejected:
  it caught nothing yet, but it is exactly the boot-time invariant check
  this project keeps; the audit showed its cost, not its uselessness).
  Gating the assert out of fast-boot (rejected: then safe and fast
  diverge on an invariant, and the safe−fast delta stops meaning
  "verification cost" and starts meaning "different kernels"). Keeping
  the walk and just labeling it (rejected: ~6 ms for a subtraction's
  worth of information fails D-0014 in the other direction).
- **Rationale:** the audit's sharpest finding was that this walk hid
  inside a stamp named "freeze". The fix demonstrates the ladder's
  preferred move: keep the check, collapse its cost, and let the
  before/after row show paranoia becoming free.
- **Consequences:** `free_count()` stops being evidence about list
  integrity (the counter is bookkeeping, not a walk); integrity evidence
  lives in the safe build's cross-check and the stress storm. The
  freeze-adjacent `accounting` phase delta should collapse to ~µs;
  finding 7's ~6 ms prediction is the before row. The safe profile's
  `freeze()` still evaluates `free_count()` as a `println!` argument
  (fast-boot compiles that print out) — a second full-list walk after
  the accounting stamp. This design would have fixed **two** walks on
  the safe profile, not one. **2026-08-17:** not landed. T4.4's bump
  arithmetic is the same `free_count()` collapse without a counter on
  the 31k-node list.

## D-0061: `-bios none` measurement variant (scoped amendment to D-0003)
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted (investigation; lands at T4.7 or
  is abandoned by its own criteria)
- **Decision:** one variant exists to measure firmware cost by removal.
  `-bios default` remains the platform and the default for every gate
  and every primary number; the variant is a build lane and one report
  exhibit. Design: a pure-boot M-mode shim linked at 0x8000_0000 in the
  same ELF (second LOAD segment; kernel keeps its 0x8020_0000 link
  address and S-mode identity). The shim programs a PMP catch-all, full
  delegation (`medeleg`/`mideleg`), `mcounteren.TM`, `menvcfg.STCE`
  (Sstc), then `mret`s into the existing `_start`. **No resident M-mode
  services:** timer = `csrw stimecmp` at D-0018's reserved one-site
  seam; console = polled NS16550A TX in S-mode (D-0004 revisited for
  this variant only); shutdown = sifive_test store (D-0017's toolbox);
  UART and sifive_test pages mapped at build (D-0039 pattern). `mtvec`
  points at a park-with-diagnostic — after boot, any M-mode trap is a
  bug and says so. **Allowlisted S-kernel seams:** entry, timer-arm
  site, console backend, shutdown backend, the two page mappings.
  **Abandon criteria, returns-based:** stop and write up the partial
  result if (a) the variant demands S-kernel changes beyond the
  allowlist, (b) the first working boot shows E0→E4 savings under 2× the
  largest remaining S-mode rung, or (c) M-mode debugging exceeds what
  the DEBUGGING.md channels can name.
- **Alternatives considered:** pure M-mode kernel (rejected: `satp` does
  not govern M-mode, so paging/W^X/U-isolation — the project's identity
  and its measurable syscall boundary — evaporate). Resident mini-SBI
  implementing DBCN/TIME/SRST behind the same ecall ABI (rejected: keeps
  an M trap handler, an M stack, and the MTI→STIP forwarding dance — the
  structure whose cost we are removing, rebuilt small). Skipping the
  variant and citing OpenSBI's cost as an assumption (rejected: it is
  the largest single term in the honest number; floor-finding measures
  it or does not claim it).
- **Rationale:** the with/without pair turns firmware cost from an
  assumption into a measurement, and it carries a structural finding no
  table row can: mainline riscv64 Linux is an S-mode SBI consumer and
  cannot take this rung — the unikernel can absorb the firmware layer,
  the general-purpose OS cannot. Sstc is available here precisely
  because we own `menvcfg` — D-0018's objection was unprobeability under
  firmware, and the entry reserved the one-site seam this variant uses.
- **Consequences:** variant touchpoints per audit finding 29 (`-bios
  default` in four harness locations; `measure-e2.sh`'s reset asserts
  are meaningless under the variant; `linker.ld` entry; check-utext's
  kernel_lo stays valid). A `just test-m` lane covers a gate subset
  (boot, net, HTTP, fast-release); the full 16-gate list stays on
  `-bios default`. Delegating cause 2 becomes possible in the variant
  (M2's undelegated-illegal-instruction limit would lift) — noted as an
  observation, not built upon: scope stays measurement. E2 ≈ E1 in the
  variant; the firmware row of its table is ~0 by construction and the
  exhibit says so.

- Amended by D-0079 (2026-08-19): the `mtvec` park-with-diagnostic
  cannot fire on the two worst bring-up failures; the shim also
  preloads `stvec`. Gap and reasoning recorded there.

## D-0062: Linux baseline — buildroot, /init-is-the-server, two rows
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted; amended 2026-08-18 (T4.8
  pins, approved sign-offs, and pre-registered gates — amendment at
  the end of this entry)
- **Decision:** buildroot at a pinned release, sha-recorded.
  `qemu_riscv64_virt_defconfig` base; kernel config trimmed toward
  tinyconfig keeping serial console, virtio-mmio + virtio-net, IPv4 TCP,
  initramfs, devtmpfs, ELF binfmt; modules, IPv6, block, and everything
  else discoverable-as-unused off; each delta lives in a committed
  defconfig fragment. **Two Linux rows:** trimmed (primary — the
  good-faith floor attempt) and stock defconfig (reference — what tuning
  bought). Initramfs is a hand-rolled cpio containing `/init` and a
  console node; `/init` *is* the server: static C, no busybox, no shell —
  socket, `SO_REUSEADDR`, bind :80, listen, write `READY`, accept loop,
  single read, write the byte-identical 92-byte response, close.
  Cmdline primary: `console=ttyS0 quiet loglevel=0 rdinit=/init`;
  secondary instrumented config: `loglevel=7` + `CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME` +
  `initcall_debug`. **Edge mapping:** cross-system comparisons ride only
  on client-observed edges (E0 → first-connect, E0 → E4), identical for
  all systems; Linux's phase decomposition comes from the instrumented
  run's printk/initcall timestamps and is presented as its own exhibit
  with the asymmetry stated — different instrument, measured on the
  logging config, quiet-vs-instrumented headline delta shown. Identical
  conditions: same QEMU binary, `-machine virt`, single CPU, default
  128 MiB, same netdev/hostfwd/filter-dump.
- **Alternatives considered:** busybox init + httpd (rejected: every
  userspace byte between kernel and server is a confound; PID-1-is-the-
  accept-loop is the honest analogue of app-in-image). One
  maximally-tuned Linux row (rejected: invites "you hobbled Linux" and
  "you didn't tune enough" simultaneously; two rows plus a published
  config make the tuning claim falsifiable). Fabricating E2-anchored
  stamps for Linux from serial timing (rejected: precision theater;
  coarser-but-labeled beats fake-comparable). Distro kernel + custom
  initramfs (rejected: unpinnable config surface; buildroot pins the
  whole toolchain).
- **Rationale:** the comparison's integrity lives in the shared
  client-observed edges and the identical wire artifact (same 92 bytes,
  same handshake shape in the pcap); everything guest-internal is
  per-system evidence, honestly labeled. The threats section states
  plainly that a Linux boot-time specialist could likely do better and
  the config is published for falsification — we claim *a* minimal
  Linux, not *the* minimal Linux.
- **Consequences:** `bench/linux/` (or equivalent) holds the defconfig
  fragment, `server.c`, and a build script with pinned tarball hash;
  D-0030's reservation-vs-working-set caveat attaches to the memory
  exhibit. The build is host-heavy but mechanical and cached.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — T4.8 implementation pins and
  pre-registrations; all six sign-off items approved):**
  1. **Pin protocol.** Buildroot 2026.02 LTS. The exact point
     release, tarball sha256, and the kernel version that release
     pins are committed to `bench/linux/PIN` and echoed into this
     entry *before* any build output is used. No artifact from an
     unpinned tree is ever measured.
  2. **One instrumented cmdline, not a second config.**
     `printk.time=1` on the kernel cmdline replaces
     `CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME`; the instrumented arm is the same trimmed
     `Image` with `console=ttyS0 loglevel=7 printk.time=1
     initcall_debug rdinit=/init`. The quiet-vs-instrumented delta
     is therefore pure observer cost on one binary.
  3. **External `-initrd` for both Linux rows** (uncompressed cpio).
     Embedding would be a kernel-config delta on the stock row,
     which would stop it being stock. Whimbrel has no `-initrd`;
     stated necessary difference; the load lands in S (D-0071).
  4. **`csum=off` (and the TSO family off) on the shared
     virtio-net-device args for the cross-system campaign.**
     Neutralizes checksum-offload pcap corruption. A no-op for
     Whimbrel, which never negotiates those features; Whimbrel arms
     are re-measured inside the same campaign, and the T4.6 ladder
     pins stay on their recorded objects and old argv.
  5. **The 92-byte HTTP-length pin applies to Linux rows too** —
     the response is byte-identical by construction. The D-0071
     spec line saying other systems' bodies "are not 92 B" is
     corrected in `results/README.md`.
  6. **Uniform client recv timeout**, tied to the trial timeout and
     identical for every system: the hardcoded 2 s recv timeout
     cannot measure a guest slower than ~2 s to first byte. Not a
     per-system knob. Landed in `scripts/bench-client.py`
     (`--timeout-s` is the recv timeout); the dedicated host
     executes the campaign.
  7. **Five arms, one campaign, interleaved:** whimbrel-fast,
     whimbrel-safe, linux-trimmed, linux-stock,
     linux-trimmed-instrumented; two shuffled batches × 30 recorded
     + 3 warmup per arm; stability criterion per arm.
  8. **Announce mechanism (confound A fix):** after ifup, `/init`
     sends one UDP datagram toward 10.0.2.2. The invariant is the
     guest's **first wire TX**, not ARP specifically: with a cold
     ARP cache the kernel emits an ARP request for the gateway
     first (Whimbrel's D-0046 shape); with a warm cache (slirp's
     own frames during boot, an entry populated at ifup) the
     datagram itself is the first frame. slirp learns the guest
     MAC from whichever frame leaves first and flushes the queued
     hostfwd SYN either way — the SYN-grid gate is stated on first
     TX, not on ARP. Chosen over an AF_PACKET gratuitous ARP so
     `CONFIG_PACKET` stays out of the trim.
  9. **`/init` ordering (confound B fix):** socket → bind → listen
     **before** ifup and the announce, so a SYN flushed at first TX
     meets LISTEN and never a pre-listen RST.
  10. **Serve-once-then-poweroff:** one accepted connection, one
      read, the 92 bytes, close, `reboot(RB_POWER_OFF)` — QEMU
      exits and the trial ends the way a Whimbrel trial does.
  11. **`/init` stamps are captured in memory and dumped after
      close** (D-0068 discipline). Correction to the planning chat:
      `loglevel=0` gates printk, not userspace writes to
      `/dev/console` — a mid-boot stamp print would be real UART
      cost on the measured path. Only the 6-byte `READY` marker is
      written before the response.
- **Pre-registered gates (responses stated before any number
  exists; same shape as the stability criterion):**
  1. **SYN-grid gate (confound A).** Per Linux trial, warmup
     included, from the pcap: t(first SYN into the guest) −
     t(guest first TX) < 1 ms. **One gridded trial fails the
     batch** — not reported as a fraction: a batch with 10% gridded
     trials has a clean-looking median and a poisoned mean, and
     bimodal contamination must not hide behind a median. Response
     when fired: the announce TX is not doing its job, or slirp's
     retransmit behavior changed — diagnose in the pcap (is the
     announce present? did the SYN snap to a ≥1 s retransmit grid?)
     before any rerun. No Linux row publishes from a batch with a
     gridded trial.
  2. **RST gate (confound B).** Any RST in any Linux trial pcap
     fails the run. Response: `/init` ordering regression or an
     unexpected early connection; diagnose, fix, rerun.
  3. **Trimmed-vs-stock tripwire, as a real gate.** At summarize
     time, per batch: if median E0→E4(trimmed) ≥ median
     E0→E4(stock) in either batch, the trim removed something
     load-bearing (enabled a slow fallback path rather than
     removing a feature). The trimmed row is **not published**.
     Response: diagnose with the instrumented arm (initcall/printk
     diff against one stock instrumented boot), amend the fragment
     — or record the surprising truth with its diagnosis attached —
     and rerun the campaign. The stock row may publish alone in the
     interim; it is the untouched reference.
  4. **First-connect control** (D-0071 spec): every arm within
     1 ms; a miss fails the run. If it fires because a QEMU version
     reordered image load ahead of netdev init, that is a finding
     about the control — diagnose with the D-0071 pcap-write poll
     before accepting any run or widening the bound.
- **Orientation ranges (padded per D-0069; not falsifiers — the
  gates above are the falsifiers):** trimmed E0→E4 0.3–5 s; stock
  2–20 s; first-connect 18.5 ± 1 ms on every arm; Linux `d_fin_ns`
  sub-ms, same order as Whimbrel's 63–155 µs.
- Build execution: `just linux-build` is a bench-host spec
  (`results/README.md`), same pattern as D-0067/D-0071 — the cloud
  pod has neither the disk nor the toolchain for buildroot.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — trim: EXPERT on, MODULES kept):** The
  first `linux-build` produced Image-trimmed 29.7 MB vs Image-stock
  27.4 MB. `CONFIG_MODULES=n` retypes every tristate as bool
  (`sym_get_type`) and canonicalizes `m` to `y` (`calc_value`);
  stock→trim was 195 `m → y` and 0 `m → n`. That is not a floor.
  `MODULES` stays y (nothing in the cpio `insmod`s; the loader is
  dead weight, the 195 drivers are not). Five unsets (`BLOCK`,
  `PROC_FS`, `SYSFS`, `KALLSYMS`, `NAMESPACES`) are EXPERT-gated
  (`bool … if EXPERT`, default y). Stock + `EXPERT=y` alone: 89
  diffs, 86 of them new unsets; three interesting (`EXPERT`,
  `PCIE_BUS_DEFAULT` which dies with `PCI` off,
  `MEDIA_HIDE_ANCILLARY_SUBDRV` going away). `CONFIG_EXPERT=y` is
  in the fragment so those five unsets stick. `EFI` stays an
  annotated override (`PORTABLE` `select EFI`); `NONPORTABLE=y` is
  a board-personality change we will not make.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — initcall_debug vs the trim, D-0072):**
  The T4.8 instrumented serial (`results/serial/`, `d705ecb`) has
  `initcall_debug` on the cmdline and zero initcall entries in 151
  timestamped printk lines. Two factors, in this order: (1)
  `loglevel=7` filters `KERN_DEBUG` — necessary and sufficient for
  the missing lines; (2) `# CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not set` affects
  names only. `PM: Calling 0xffffffff800614ec` in the same log
  proves `%pS` still prints without kallsyms. A sixth campaign arm
  with kallsyms is declined (D-0072): it would describe a different
  binary than the trimmed row. Labeling the 327 ms printk hole is a
  diagnostic boot of the *same* `Image-trimmed` with
  `ignore_loglevel`, addresses resolved offline from `System.map`.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — FTRACE is a missed trim, D-0072
  labels):** the diagnostic boot named `trace_eval_sync` as 68% of
  the 327 ms hole. `menuconfig FTRACE` defaults y when
  `DEBUG_KERNEL=y`; the riscv `defconfig` sets `DEBUG_KERNEL=y`;
  the fragment never unsets `FTRACE` / `TRACING` / `DEBUG_KERNEL`.
  `FTRACE` is not EXPERT-gated, so `# CONFIG_FTRACE is not set`
  would have stuck. That is a miss, not a documented keep.
  `CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM=y` remains a keep (ttyS0 from DT).
  We still claim *a* minimal Linux, not *the* minimal Linux.
  **Superseded in part by D-0073:** the miss is acted on (new
  Image, T4.8b campaign). T4.8 stays the before.

## D-0063: Unikraft spike — go/no-go and the no-core-patches line
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted (pin recorded 2026-08-22; go
  criteria **not met** at the pin, abandon line held — see Outcome;
  fallback (3) selected 2026-08-23 — see Fallback choice)
- **Decision:** pin the unikraft/unikraft PR #1698 branch commit and the
  kraftkit version in this entry when the spike starts. **Go** = the
  HTTP example builds for qemu/riscv64 at the pin, boots on our pinned
  QEMU with documented flag deltas, and answers the harness client.
  **No-go** = build failure surviving config-level fixes; riscv64
  network path nonfunctional; or any fix requiring patches to Unikraft
  internals. **The no-core-patches line is both the go/no-go and the
  abandon criterion:** config and build-system fixes leave "Unikraft"
  meaning Unikraft; core patches would make the row "our fork", which
  contaminates the comparison — the spike ends where configuring their
  system becomes developing it. Fallback outcomes per D-0043, in report
  terms: (1) works — three-way on client-observed edges plus their
  native boot instrumentation as a labeled per-system exhibit;
  (2) different-ISA only — a separate exhibit that never shares a table
  with riscv64 numbers, plus a source-level riscv64 boot-path analysis;
  (3) does not run — two-way quantitative plus a qualitative Unikraft
  section from source, stated in the abstract, not a footnote.
  "Identical conditions" = same host, same pinned QEMU (a required
  different QEMU version triggers a Whimbrel control row under that QEMU
  to bound the version effect), same machine/slirp/hostfwd topology,
  same client protocol, same first-byte edge; every deviation goes in a
  deltas table. Sequenced immediately after the baseline freeze so the
  comparison section's shape settles while the draft is young.
- **Alternatives considered:** patching their riscv64 port to make the
  three-way happen (rejected: the number would describe our fork).
  Waiting for the PR to merge (rejected: unbounded external dependency;
  the fallback ladder exists so the report converges regardless).
  Skipping Unikraft (rejected: the comparison against a mature unikernel
  is the context that makes the floor claim interesting).
- **Rationale:** the spike is bounded structurally, not by calendar: its
  end state is one of three pre-named report shapes, so no outcome is a
  schedule failure — only an unrecorded outcome would be.
- **Consequences:** the pin (commit + kraftkit version) is recorded here
  at spike start; whichever fallback fires, the report's abstract states
  the comparison shape in its opening paragraphs.
- **Pin (recorded 2026-08-22, from live GitHub state; nothing built or
  run):** unikraft = PR #1698 head
  `e9b1d5496bd9d0678b035dde2986171bf4398c56` (zzSunil/unikraft
  `staging`, committed 2026-06-15T08:17:11Z; PR open, not draft, zero
  reviews, one author comment; base `be744898`, reported
  clean-mergeable against upstream `staging` `e31b2c44` of
  2026-08-12). kraftkit = v0.12.15 (2026-08-05, tag `0f4c1222`) is the
  latest stable release and **lacks riscv64**; riscv64 support is
  kraftkit#2900, merged to `staging` 2026-08-09 as `5019204e`, first
  shipped in prerelease `v0.12.15-11-g5019204e` — the spike pins that
  prerelease and records that it is not a stable release. Application
  = catalog-core `c-http` at `7196610a` (2026-05-16), a make-driven
  build over lib-lwip `ec55ae17` (2026-04-15) and nolibc; built with
  Unikraft's own Makefile (`UK_DEFCONFIG`), not `kraft build`, and run
  through `scripts/qemu-args.sh`, so kraftkit is on record but off the
  critical path (`kraft run` on riscv64 would add `-cpu max` and
  `virtio-net-pci`, both deltas against Whimbrel, and the second is
  dead on riscv64 — see below). **Correction to this entry's
  premise:** it assumed the PR branch would have moved between
  2026-08-16 and the pin. It has not: the head is unchanged since
  2026-06-15, and no riscv-related issue, PR, or `staging` commit has
  touched unikraft/unikraft since 2026-08-01 (search returns zero; the
  original port #461 was last touched 2026-04-22; #804 remains open).
  D-0045's "kraftkit riscv64 merged" was true of `staging` from
  2026-08-09, not of any release.
- **Outcome (2026-08-22, source analysis at the pin): go criteria not
  met; the abandon line held.** Two no-go criteria fired
  independently: **riscv64 network path nonfunctional**, and **the
  fix requires a patch to Unikraft internals**. Either alone is a
  no-go; the second is also the abandon criterion, and it held rather
  than being crossed — no patch was written. The trace, so a reader
  can check it rather than trust it:
  1. `c-http` → `LIBLWIP` → `LIBUKNETDEV` → `LIBVIRTIO_NET` →
     `LIBVIRTIO_BUS` (`drivers/virtio/bus/Config.uk`), which implies
     `LIBVIRTIO_PCI if HAVE_PCI` and `LIBVIRTIO_MMIO if HAVE_MMIO`;
     `KVM_VMM_QEMU` (`plat/kvm/Config.uk`) selects both `HAVE_PCI` and
     `HAVE_MMIO` with no arch condition.
  2. On the MMIO transport — Whimbrel's topology, `virtio-net-device`
     — `LIBVIRTIO_MMIO` is not arch-gated and `LIBVIRTIO_MMIO_FDT`
     defaults on whenever `LIBFDT && LIBUKOFW`, which the PR selects
     for riscv64. The platform bus (`drivers/ukbus/platform/
     platform_bus.c`, `pf_probe_fdt`, ~l.144) walks every node whose
     compatible is in `pf_device_compatible_list` (`virtio,mmio`,
     `pci-host-ecam-generic`, `arm,pl031`) and calls the driver's
     `probe` *before* `add_dev`. `virtio_mmio_probe_fdt`
     (`drivers/virtio/mmio/virtio_mmio.c`, ~l.423) calls
     `uk_intctlr_irq_fdt_xlat(dtb, offs, 0, &irq)` unconditionally.
  3. The generic layer (`lib/ukintctlr/ukintctlr.c:212–225`) does
     `UK_ASSERT(uk_intctlr->ops->fdt_xlat)` then calls through it. The
     PR's PLIC driver (`drivers/ukintctlr/plic/ukintctlr.c`) registers
     `plic_ops` with **`.fdt_xlat = __NULL`** and a `configure_irq`
     that returns 0 without reading the IRQ. Asserts on → `UK_CRASH`;
     asserts off → indirect call to address 0 → fetch fault →
     unhandled trap.
  4. QEMU's `virt` machine always presents **eight** `virtio,mmio`
     transports in the DTB whether or not a device is attached, and
     the magic/dummy-ID check that would skip an empty transport lives
     in `virtio_mmio_add_dev`, which runs after `probe`. So the crash
     fires on the first transport, during bus probing, **before
     `main`**, in any riscv64 build with `LIBVIRTIO_MMIO=y`. Go
     criterion 2 (boots) fails together with criterion 3 (answers the
     client); only a network-less build can boot.
  5. The fix is a ~15-line `plic_fdt_xlat` reading the one-cell
     `interrupts` property (PLIC `#interrupt-cells = <1>`) plus a real
     `configure_irq` — new code in a Unikraft driver, which is exactly
     what the no-core-patches line forbids.
  **Closed escape routes, each with why.** (a) PCI transport:
  `drivers/ukbus/pci/Config.uk` has `LIBUKBUS_PCI depends on
  (ARCH_X86_64 || ARCH_ARM_64)`, untouched by the PR, so
  `virtio-net-pci` (what kraftkit emits for every arch,
  `machine/qemu/v1alpha1.go:298,342`) attaches a NIC Unikraft cannot
  enumerate; flipping that one line drags in the ECAM driver, whose
  FDT-interrupt parsing has its own open fix (#804), and the ECAM path
  needs the same `fdt_xlat` regardless. (b) Command-line devices:
  `VIRTIO_MMIO_LINUX_COMPAT_CMDLINE` / `virtio_mmio.device=` exists in
  `drivers/virtio/mmio/Config.uk`, but `virtio_mmio.c` in this tree
  has zero libparam references and `virtio_mmio_probe` has only the
  FDT branch — a Kconfig orphan. (c) Disabling FDT probing:
  `LIBVIRTIO_MMIO_FDT` is a promptless `bool` with `default y if
  (LIBFDT && LIBUKOFW)`, so it cannot be switched off from `.config`.
  (d) Stripping the `virtio,mmio` nodes: that is a hand-edited machine
  description passed via `-dtb`, not a flag delta, and it would also
  remove the transport the NIC needs.
  **Why the port is in this state.** This is a **regression from
  #461**, not a gap Unikraft never filled: #461 (eduardvintila, 2022)
  describes PCI and MMIO probing as "virtually identical" to the ARM
  implementation and reports Redis, NGINX, SQLite and Python running,
  all of which need the network. The `uk_intctlr` driver-ops API
  (`fdt_xlat`, `configure_irq`) postdates 2022; the 2026 rebase that
  is #1698 stubbed it (`plic.c` carries a `// leave it alone at the
  moment, seems like just not used anymore` on `plic_ack_irq`). The
  PR's own checklist says Application(s): N/A and "tested on Qemu
  10.0.3", consistent with a hello-world-only port. The accurate
  statement for the report is therefore not "Unikraft lacks riscv64"
  but "this rebase has not reconnected the interrupt path to device
  discovery".
  **What looked right, for the boot-path analysis either fallback
  needs:** trap dispatch (`plat/kvm/riscv/traps.c`, `_trap_handler`:
  `SUPERVISOR_EXT → plic_handle_irq` with a claim/complete loop,
  timer via SBI with `sbi_set_timer(-1)` as the ack); PLIC enable plus
  priority 1 on unmask (`plic_clear_irq`) and threshold 0 at init;
  `fence`-based `mb/rmb/wmb` for the virtio ring
  (`arch/riscv/riscv64/include/uk/asm/lcpu.h:85–96`); MMIO mapping via
  `uk_bus_pf_devmap` with plain RW attributes, which is sufficient
  under Sv39 on TCG; lib-lwip and nolibc carry no arch gating and the
  PR adds the riscv64 nolibc bits `c-http` needs; `virtio_mmio.c`
  accepts device versions 1–2, so `-global
  virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false` is compatible; OpenSBI's
  `0x80000000` residency is special-cased in
  `plat/common/bootinfo_fdt.c`. **Not verified** (no build, no run):
  TLS and context-switch correctness (`arch/riscv/ctx.c`, `tls.c`),
  the timer under load, whether riscv64 nolibc is complete enough for
  lwip's build, and whether the port boots at all on QEMU 10.2.1
  (author tested 10.0.3).
  **Review liabilities bearing on merge timing:** two cross-arch core
  edits ride in the PR. `lib/ukboot/boot.c` changes the constructor
  call from `(*ctorfn)(argc, argv)` to `(*ctorfn)()` for *all*
  architectures; `lib/uklcpu/lcpu.c` adds a fallback in
  `uk_lcpu_get_current_idx_in_except` when the exception-stack base is
  0 (which the riscv64 port returns). Both need a maintainer's
  attention beyond the riscv64 directories, and the PR has had no
  review in the 68 days since it was reopened.
  **Standing:** this is a finding, not a failure — the entry's own
  framing is that only an unrecorded outcome would be one. The pin is
  recorded, the go criteria were not met, the abandon line held, and
  the fallback choice between (2) and (3) is deferred to a separate
  decision. The one route back to (1) that does not cross the line is
  the stub being fixed in the PR branch itself and the spike re-pinning
  to that head; it is noted, not planned.
- **Fallback choice (2026-08-23): (3) selected** — two-way
  quantitative plus a qualitative Unikraft section from source,
  stated in the abstract, not a footnote. Against (2): its
  quantitative half is a Unikraft number on arm64 or x86_64 that, by
  this entry's own rule, never shares a table with riscv64 numbers —
  a build, a campaign, and an exhibit spent producing a figure the
  reader is then told not to compare with anything else in the
  report. The substrate-comparability discipline that makes the
  Linux ratios meaningful — same host, same pinned QEMU, the
  emulation penalty applying to both arms — is exactly what a
  cross-ISA row cannot have. (2)'s qualitative half is the part with
  value, and it is already done: the trace in this entry's Outcome
  is the source-level riscv64 boot-path analysis (2) asked for, so
  (3) keeps everything of (2) that survives scrutiny and drops only
  the incomparable number. Recorded explicitly so the absence is a
  stated methodological choice, not a gap a reader must guess about:
  a cross-ISA build was available at the pin (qemu/x86_64 or
  qemu/arm64, where Unikraft is routinely built and `c-http` is a
  catalog example) and was deliberately not run, for the reason
  above. Consequences: the comparison section converges in shape (3)
  — the D-0064 gate's "selected fallback shape"; the abstract states
  it in its opening paragraphs per this entry's Consequences; the
  qualitative section lives in Results beside the Linux boot
  decomposition, stubbed in the draft now and written at T4.11 from
  this entry's Outcome. T4.9's acceptance (section exists in the
  draft) stays open until the stub is written.

## D-0064: Report structure, claims discipline, convergence, audits
- Date: 2026-08-16 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** report structure: abstract → background (short) →
  architecture of the apparatus (decision-log distilled; the deliberate
  U/S choice and its measurement consequence; what our TCP omits and why
  it is invisible at this workload) → methodology (edges per D-0043,
  protocol per D-0055, client, pinning, stamp overhead) → results →
  threats to validity → future work → appendices. **Centerpiece exhibit
  columns, fixed now:** phase | what the work is | safe median | fast
  median | fast IQR | fast min | after-ladder median | Δ vs baseline |
  structurally necessary? — one row per attributed phase; the safe−fast
  pair is the price-of-paranoia finding; the last column is the
  floor-finding argument made row by row. Companion exhibits: the ladder
  table (rung × cumulative E2→E3g, declined rungs included with
  reasons) and the cross-system table (system × E0→first-connect,
  E0→E4, image bytes, RAM; median/IQR/min; N stated). **Claims
  discipline:** results claim only measured medians under stated
  conditions; "fastest" never appears without its conditions clause in
  the same sentence; floor language is "minimum structurally necessary
  under these conditions, bounded below by the rows argued necessary";
  the Linux row is "a minimal Linux tuned in good faith, config
  published". **Appendix, created with the skeleton:** "numbers that
  must be regenerated" — seeded from audit findings 16–23, listing every
  inherited quantitative claim with its disposition (regenerate /
  historical-only / structural), so the kill-list exists before any
  prose does. **Draft-early:** the skeleton is written with real numbers
  at T4.3; all later work edits the draft; exhibit tables are generated
  from CSV. **Second audit:** inside T4.11, after the
  content-complete draft — same findings-only format as
  `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`, scoped to what changed since it (superpage
  walker/verifier as landed, harness as-built, the `-bios none` shim if
  it landed, and every report number checked against the CSVs that
  claim to generate it); recorded as `docs/AUDIT-<date>.md`; blockers
  fixed before revision. **Convergence
  gate** (duplicated in PLAN.md; the PLAN copy is normative): harness
  stable and all numbers regenerated; ladder closed by the 5% bar;
  `-bios none` concluded either way; comparison section in its selected
  fallback shape; threats each mitigated-and-measured or stated; second
  audit's blockers closed; sign-off.
- **Alternatives considered:** writing the report after the data is
  "done" (rejected: draft-early is the structural rule — a skeleton with
  real numbers exists from T4.3 and everything edits it). Hand-typed
  exhibit tables (rejected: the one mechanism that guarantees prose
  cannot drift from data is generating tables from the CSVs). Skipping
  a second audit because the first was clean-ish (rejected: the first
  audit's premise — green gates do not certify labels — applies with
  more force to code written during a measurement campaign).
- **Rationale:** the report is the artifact; its integrity mechanisms —
  generated exhibits, the regeneration appendix, pre-registered
  predictions citable from `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`, a scoped second
  audit — are what let it claim floor-finding instead of benchmarketing.
- **Consequences:** `report/` lives in-repo; markdown source plus a
  table-generation script that `git show`s freeze CSVs from tag
  `baseline-t4.3` and after-ladder CSVs from a named git object
  (D-0067 — the harness overwrites `results/*.csv` per run; HEAD may
  hold a later non-rung batch). Regenerating cited numbers from
  those objects is the acceptance test; the
  threats-to-validity list opened at T4.0 (TCG ≠ hardware; slirp as
  peer; client granularity measured; single hart and fixed RAM;
  debug-era history killed by the regeneration rule; Linux-tuning
  fairness; Unikraft pin; instrumentation observer effect; host
  variance; E3w fidelity; E3w→E4 host remainder per D-0066;
  reservation vs working set per D-0030; estimate bias per D-0069;
  TCG-trace secondaries as a matched pair under item 16; D-0068
  dump occupancy tested and not confirmed; E3w→E4 open) is
  maintained in the draft from day one.

## D-0065: Bump-pointer / lazy free list (T4.4; amends D-0019)
- Date: 2026-08-17 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** `frame::init` no longer links `[__heap_end, RAM_END)` into
  an intrusive list. Virgin frames are a bump pointer `BUMP`, starting
  at `__heap_end`. The intrusive list (`HEAD`) holds only frames that
  were allocated and then freed. `alloc_frame` pops `HEAD` if nonempty
  (preserves LIFO for `FRAME OK` / the storm), else hands out `BUMP` and
  advances it. `free_count()` is `(RAM_END − BUMP) / PAGE_SIZE + RECYCLED`
  — arithmetic, no walk. `frame::freeze()` is unchanged: one bool store,
  then `alloc_frame` / `free_frame` panic printing the request. D-0036's
  two reasons (trap path does not allocate; after `sret` no kernel code
  runs with `SIE=1`) do not depend on how free frames are represented
  and still hold. D-0060 (allocated counter on the old 31k-node list) is
  declined-by-subsumption: this representation *is* the accounting.
- **Alternatives considered:** D-0060 first, then bump (rejected: a
  counter on the current list collapses `accounting` and leaves
  `frame_init` at 7.20 ms; bump does both). Bump-only with no recycled
  list (rejected: `self_test` and `stress` free frames; LIFO would
  break). Walking `HEAD` for `free_count()` after the change (rejected:
  that counts recycled nodes only, and the frames-consumed assert fires
  on correct code). Bitmap (still rejected, D-0019).
- **Rationale:** T4.3 freeze: `frame_init` 7.20 ms (34%) and
  `accounting` 4.79 ms (22%) are two walks of ~31k frames. The list
  existed because every virgin frame was a node. Stop building the
  nodes and both walks go away. Pre-T4.2 numbering (accounting as rung
  1, bump as rung 3) was superseded by the attribution data; T4.2 put
  bump first but still listed D-0060 as a separate next rung.
- **Consequences — projected gain, pre-registered against
  `baseline-t4.3` (pooled n=60) before the bench-host rerun:**
  - `frame_init` 7.20 ms → **< 100 µs** (expected ~10–50 µs). The stamp
    includes `check_dtb` (two header loads) plus init (a handful of
    stores). Falsified if the median stays ≥ 1 ms (the walk is still
    there) or if it exceeds 100 µs without a named leftover.
  - `accounting` 4.79 ms → **< 20 µs** (expected ~5–15 µs, freeze-class).
    Falsified if the median stays ≥ 1 ms.
  - fast E2→E3g 21.42 ms → **~9.5 ms** (21.42 − 7.20 − 4.79, plus a
    few tens of µs of leftover). Falsified if still > 15 ms or if a
    third phase vanishes that this hypothesis does not name.
  - safe `freeze` 4.88 ms → **< 50 µs** (the println still evaluates
    `free_count()`, now arithmetic). Not the flagship number; same
    rewrite.
- **Consequences — co-edit checklist (D-0059-shaped; every item walked
  in this change or the rung does not merge):**
  1. `page::tables_used()` / the 67 derivation (`src/page.rs`) —
     **unchanged at T4.4.** Leaf count did not move. D-0059 later
     moved this to `EXPECTED_TABLES` = 5.
  2. `task::enter` `held = total − free`, `tables != 67`,
     `held != tables + leftover` — **unchanged at T4.4.** Arithmetic
     `free_count` keeps `held` equal to frames actually handed out
     (67 fast / 69 default then; 5 / 7 after D-0059).
  3. D-0036's "69 = 67 tables + 2 leftovers" and D-0039's
     `tables_used is 67` — **unchanged at T4.4.** D-0059 later
     moved this to 7 = 5 tables + 2 leftovers.
  4. `just test-stress` `assert_restored` — **meaning changes,
     check stays.** It compared free-list *length*; the 31k list is
     gone. It now compares *available* frames (`free_count`, virgin
     remainder + recycled) and walks the recycled list against
     `RECYCLED` so counter drift cannot hide (finding 30).
  5. `frame-exhaust-selftest` — **still panics `out of frames
     (total N)`.** Exhaustion is bump-at-`RAM_END` with an empty
     recycled list, not a drained 31k list. `justfile` still greps
     `^frames [0-9]+ heap_start=` against that N.
  6. `frames frozen: free=` grep — **unchanged.** Freeze still
     prints it.
  7. D-0023: header check still before init; init no longer writes
     through the DTB. Those PAs are clobbered if and when bump
     reaches them (not on the measured path: ~67 frames from
     `__heap_end`, DTB at `0x87e0_0000`).
  8. D-0028: mutation is now bump-or-`HEAD`; freeze still covers it.
  Superpage items (D-0059 #3–5, #7–8: `walk`/`assert_range`/
  `require_leaf`, virtq L0, probe-format greps, DEBUGGING
  superpage note) — **N/A.**
- **Consequences — measured T4.4 (dedicated host, batches
  `20260817T052349Z-1`/`-2`, git_sha `83ca9f99`, n=60, steal 0,
  stability PASS both configs):**
  | metric | predicted | actual | verdict |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | fast `frame_init` | < 100 µs | 141.2 µs | bound missed; ≥ 1 ms falsify held |
  | fast `accounting` | < 20 µs | 24.9 µs | bound missed; ≥ 1 ms falsify held |
  | fast E2→E3g | ~9.5 ms | 9.17 ms | beat the projection |
  | safe `freeze` | < 50 µs | 100.0 µs | bound missed; collapsed from 4.88 ms |
  Mechanism and magnitude were correct. Point estimates on the three
  leftover bounds were ~40% optimistic. Pair with audit finding 10
  (`task_init` / `virtq_init` / `stvec` predicted µs, measured sub-ms):
  two data points, same direction. Unnamed phases that moved without
  vanishing (`page_verify` 2.57 → 2.39 ms, `E3g` 1.42 → 1.24 ms) are a
  cache/TLB secondary of not touching ~125 MiB to link 31k nodes, not
  a falsification.
- Revisit trigger: none for the representation. Superpages (D-0059)
  landed next: T4.4 left `page_build` + `page_verify` = 3.84 ms = 42%
  of 9.17 ms, which was that entry's re-evaluation condition.

## D-0066: E3w→E4 is a host-side remainder, not an E4 stamp artifact
- Date: 2026-08-17 — Status: amended 2026-08-18 (D-0070 confirmed +
  D-0071: the term was a mislabeling, not a delivery remainder;
  retired as a reported metric — see the amendment at the end of
  this entry)
- **Decision:** after T4.4, fast E3w→E4 is 33.87 ms (IQR 432 µs, both
  batches, n=60) — the largest single term in honest E0→E4 (54.52 ms).
  E0→E3w is 20.74 ms (the HTTP frame in the filter-dump); E4 is 54.52 ms
  (first nonempty `recv` at the client). This is **not** an artifact of
  how the harness stamps E4: `scripts/bench-client.py` uses the 1 ms
  cadence for connect-retry only; after `connect()` it `sendall`s the
  GET and blocks in `recv` with a 2 s timeout; `first_byte_mono_ns` is
  that first nonempty chunk. It is **not** guest kernel compute: E2→E3g
  is already 9.17 ms and E3g is the publish. E3w is constructed as
  first-connect plus the pcap-relative SYN/ACK→HTTP interval (D-0043:
  filter-dump wall ≠ Python realtime), so E4−E3w is the time from that
  constructed "HTTP on the netdev" to Python `recv`.
  The interval is tens of milliseconds, not a µs loopback. D-0043's
  original "E4−E3w the host loopback" understated a structural term.
  It is also not a single fixed timer: freeze fast was 41.24 ms; T4.4
  fast is 33.87 ms; T4.6 fast is 31.04 ms; T4.4 safe is 94.46 ms;
  T4.6 safe is 92.50 ms. Safe vs fast scaling implicated QEMU
  occupancy after publish. The PHASE dump was the natural candidate
  (D-0068). Two N-trials of yield-then-dump left E3w→E4 untouched.
  The remainder is open.
- **Alternatives considered:** treating E4−E3w as client-cadence
  quantization (rejected: cadence does not run after connect). Treating
  it as slirp-only wire delay identical across configs (rejected: safe
  94 ms vs fast 34 ms). Moving `print_after_response` in this revision
  (rejected: that is a harness/observer experiment, pre-registered
  only as a reduction candidate; no code until someone signs it off as
  its own change).
- **Rationale:** the honest number is E0→E4. Once kernel terms drop,
  a 34 ms host-side remainder that used to hide behind 21 ms of guest
  work becomes the thing a reader will ask about. Naming it before the
  Linux baseline keeps the comparison section from attributing it to
  the guest.
- **Consequences:** methodology and threats cite this entry. Cross-system
  E0→E4 still uses the same client and slirp, so comparisons remain
  defined. D-0068 tested dump occupancy and did not take the term.
  E3w→E4 is an open threats item (~31 ms of ~52 ms), not a solved
  one. TAP / passt / `TCP_NODELAY` on hostfwd remain host-side
  candidates, not 5%-bar kernel rungs.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18, D-0070 confirmed + D-0071):** "the largest
  single term in honest E0→E4" was real arithmetic on a mislabeled
  quantity. The pcap pass decomposed it completely:
  E3w→E4 = S + W + D_recv, where S is the QEMU-startup slice between
  hostfwd listener-up (where first-connect stamps) and main-loop-live
  (where slirp emits the ARP; ~6.8 ms on the bench host, D-0071),
  W is the already-accepted connection waiting for the guest to boot
  to net-init (~24 ms fast / ~85 ms safe), and true post-publish
  delivery is bounded by `D_fin` at 63–155 µs. Nothing in the term
  was post-publish host work; S and W are time already counted once,
  correctly, inside E0→E4. The safe-vs-fast scaling that implicated
  "QEMU occupancy after publish" was W scaling with boot length.
  E3w→E4 is retired as a reported metric; delivery is reported as
  `D_fin` (generated). TAP / passt / `TCP_NODELAY` are no longer
  candidates for a term that does not exist. This entry stays as the
  record of what the number looked like before the anchor was
  questioned.

## D-0067: Per-batch result files (harness recommendation)
- Date: 2026-08-17 — Status: accepted (approved; design only — the
  bench host implements the write path; spec in `results/README.md`)
- **Decision:** recommend yes. `scripts/bench.py` currently
  `write_csv`s `results/runs.csv` and `results/phases.csv` in place
  each run. T4.4 overwrote the freeze rows; those rows live in tag
  `baseline-t4.3` (commit `bce55a2`). The exhibit generator now
  sources baseline columns from that tag and after-ladder columns
  from a named git object via `git show` (the T4.6 superpage CSV
  commit, not necessarily `HEAD`: a later non-rung batch may sit
  at HEAD), and does **not** read the working tree.
  That unblocks a two-rung table. A five-rung ladder would otherwise
  be archaeology across five commits to regenerate one exhibit.
  Recommended layout, implemented on the bench host:

  ```
  results/batches/<batch_id>/runs.csv
  results/batches/<batch_id>/phases.csv
  results/batches/<batch_id>/summary.txt
  results/runs.csv       # latest run only (overwrite, as today)
  results/phases.csv
  results/summary.txt
  ```

  At the end of each batch (and at the end of a two-batch stability
  run), copy the rows for that `batch_id` into
  `results/batches/<batch_id>/` *before* the next run can overwrite
  the top-level files. Top-level CSVs stay the latest run so
  `just bench-summary` does not change. Track `results/batches/` in
  git (unlike `results/trials/` serial/pcap). The freeze tag remains
  the baseline pin; batches are how later rungs accumulate without
  retagging.
  Exhibit generator, once those files exist: keep `--baseline-tag`
  (default `baseline-t4.3`) and add `--after-batches <id>,<id>` that
  reads `results/batches/<id>/{runs,phases}.csv` and concatenates.
  Until then, `--after` is a named git object via `git show` (T4.6
  CSV commit `c40945c`, not necessarily HEAD). Fail closed on
  mixed `git_sha`, mixed QEMU, dirty rows, n≠60, steal≠0 — same
  checks as today.
- **Alternatives considered:** append-only `results/runs.csv`
  (rejected: the summarizer and stability check assume one SHA and
  two batches; appending a third rung silently mixes denominators
  unless every consumer grows a filter). Relying on git history
  forever (rejected: `git show HEAD~N:results/runs.csv` is how we
  got here, and it does not scale). This agent implementing the
  write path (rejected: D-0055's harness lives on the bench host;
  this pod is not that host).
- **Rationale:** the exhibit's contract is "never type the numbers".
  That contract is only as strong as being able to regenerate a
  ladder table from named inputs after the fifth rung.
- **Consequences:** `results/README.md` is the bench-host spec:
  directory layout, what stays at `results/{runs,phases}.csv`, and
  the generator's `--baseline-tag` / `--after-batches` interface.
  Until those files exist, the generator stays named `git show`
  objects (baseline tag, T4.6 CSV commit, D-0068 run pins) and does
  not grow argparse. No change to
  `scripts/bench.py` in this tree.

## D-0068: Do not dump PHASE between publish and the client's first byte
- Date: 2026-08-17 — Status: accepted (landed; measured 2026-08-18;
  occupancy hypothesis not confirmed; yield kept)
- **Decision:** `print_after_response` must not run between publishing
  the HTTP response and the client reading it. **Same-boot deferral
  via a yield, then dump.** After first-HTTP `wait_tx` /
  `E3g_doorbell`, do **not** print. `timer::yield_once` asserts
  `sie.STIE` (finding 13), re-arms a future deadline, executes one
  `wfi`, then `print_after_response` and `M3 UNIKERNEL OK`. PHASE
  and the honest number stay on the same boot.
  Do **not** spin waiting for FIN or for a timer in software: a
  post-publish poll loop occupies TCG the same way the dump does
  and would still delay hostfwd. `wfi` returns the vCPU to QEMU's
  main loop so slirp/hostfwd can deliver the already-queued frame.
  Do **not** set `sstatus.SIE` around the `wfi`: the call is from
  the trap handler, hardware already cleared SIE, and setting it
  reopens D-0036. `wfi` wakes when `sip.STIP` becomes pending even
  if the interrupt is not taken. Re-arm is load-bearing: a leftover
  STIP (tick during this syscall, not taken because SIE is 0) would
  make `wfi` a no-op and leave the dump on the publish→E4 path.
  **Measured (two invocations, four batches, stability PASS):**
  E2→E3g unchanged; E0→E4 did not improve; E3w→E4 untouched in
  both profiles (`report/exhibits/dump-placement.md`). The
  pre-registered claim that this dump was the tens-of-milliseconds
  occupant is refuted for the one-tick implementation. The yield
  stays: instrumentation off the measured path is correct even
  when the measured cost is zero.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  1. **Gate the dump behind a feature so measured runs never print
     PHASE**, reading the array another way (GDB, a second boot,
     a later non-timing dump). Rejected for the comparison section.
     Flagship E0→E4 and the E2→E3g decomposition would be different
     boots. Composing firmware + guest + host remainder on one
     trial would become a cross-trial construction — a
     threats-to-validity line, and it is exactly the line we would
     be trying to avoid when we tell a reader that 34 ms of E0→E4
     is not "Whimbrel."
  2. **Harness reads phases from a run that is not the timing
     run.** Same split, plus a second boot per trial. Rejected for
     the same reason; doubles batch time for a protocol that still
     cannot compose one machine-state.
  3. **Wait for peer FIN** (the bench client `close()`s after
     `recv`, so FIN is strictly after E4). Valid *signal* that E4
     has happened, but waiting for it by polling occupies TCG
     *before* E4. FIN after a yield is optional confirmation, not
     the primary mechanism. Also couples dump progress to client
     close behavior on every HTTP gate (curl, persist).
  4. **Moving the dump in the superpage commit.** Rejected: one
     rung, no code beyond it.
  5. **Assume ticks are still armed** (rejected: finding 13. A
     later rung that drops tick arming would hang the HTTP path
     with no panic. Assert `sie.STIE` and fail loudly).
  6. **Revert the yield after the N-trial showed no E4 movement**
     (rejected: putting DBCN back on an unexplained interval
     confuses the next experiment. A `wfi` is not occupancy).
  7. **Extend to a yield that brackets ~31 ms in the same change**
     (rejected: that is a new diagnostic, not this landing. Name
     it; do not ship it unmeasured).
- **Rationale:** if the PHASE dump (DBCN, one `ecall` per byte)
  runs after publish while TCG occupies the loop that pumps slirp,
  E0→E4 measures Whimbrel's instrumentation, not Whimbrel. That
  was the hypothesis. The N-trial did not confirm it. The dump
  still should not sit on publish→E4: Linux and Unikraft have no
  equivalent, and leaving DBCN there would mix a known observer
  into an unknown remainder. Stamps stay where they are: E3g at
  publish, E3g_doorbell after notify. Only the *print* moves.
- **Consequences:** `src/timer.rs` owns `assert_ticks_armed` /
  `yield_once`; `src/net.rs` calls them after first-HTTP `wait_tx`.
  Gates that wait for `M3 UNIKERNEL OK` or PHASE lines see them up
  to one tick later. A subsequent rung that removes tick arming
  from fast-boot must replace this `wfi` first (D-0056.3 / finding
  13).
  **Why no change does not yet prove D = 0.** If dump occupancy D
  is serialized with remaining host time H, observed E3w→E4 is
  D+H. Yield Y < H reorders to Y + D + (H−Y) = D+H. One tick is
  ~10 ms; the fast gap is ~31 ms. The discriminating test is
  Y large enough to bracket that gap. Independent evidence already
  leans host-side for most of the term: the dump is `println_always`
  (identical in safe and fast, both release / opt-level 3), so it
  cannot be the 3×; E3w→E4 already moved freeze→T4.4→T4.6 with the
  dump unmoved. What scales with profile after E3g is TCG/QEMU
  state after 76 ms vs 6.4 ms of guest boot, plus safe-only
  `println!` on TX complete (tens of bytes, not 60 ms).
  E3w→E4 returns to threats as an open item (~31 ms of ~52 ms).
  **Tradeoff if someone later chooses split-boot anyway:** the
  phase decomposition and the honest E0→E4 number are not the same
  machine-state and must be stated as a threats line.
- Revisit trigger: a yield that brackets ~31 ms (discriminate
  too-short implementation from dump-irrelevant host term); or a
  tick-removal rung, which must replace the `wfi` first.

## D-0069: Pre-registration underestimates small-phase costs
- Date: 2026-08-17 — Status: accepted (finding; three data points)
- **Decision:** treat optimistic small-phase estimates as a stated
  property of this project's pre-registration, not as three
  independent misses. When a rung's *phase* projection is a range
  derived from "N operations × cheap per-op cost", expect the
  measured median to land high. Headline E2→E3g ranges that
  explicitly pad for this bias have held; the unpadded phase
  ranges have not.
  Three-for-three, all in the same direction (predicted too fast):
  1. Audit finding 10: `task_init` / `virtq_init` / `stvec` — µs
     on paper, sub-ms on the stamp table.
  2. T4.4 leftovers (D-0065): `frame_init` 141 µs vs < 100 µs,
     `accounting` 25 µs vs < 20 µs, safe `freeze` 100 µs vs < 50 µs
     (~40% optimistic). Falsify-if ≥ 1 ms held.
  3. T4.6 paging (D-0059): `page_build` 386 µs vs 50–300 µs,
     `page_verify` 731 µs vs 80–400 µs. Combined 1.12 ms vs
     0.15–0.70 ms. Fast E2→E3g 6.43 ms landed in the padded
     5.5–8.0 ms headline range.
- **Alternatives considered:** treating each overrun as a
  distinct surprise (rejected: same sign, three campaigns).
  Tightening the next rung's phase range to the linear
  extrapolation (rejected: that is the mistake). Declaring
  estimates useless (rejected: mechanism and magnitude of T4.4
  and T4.6 were correct; the headline arithmetic was exact once
  paging actually moved — 9.17 − 2.72 = 6.45 vs 6.43).
- **Rationale:** we scale as if cost were linear in operation
  count. At large N the per-call checks and TCG trace warmup
  amortize (T4.4 `page_verify` ~75 ns/leaf over ~32k leaves). At
  a few hundred they dominate (T4.6 ~1.3 µs/leaf over ~580
  leaves, ~17× the linear extrapolation of ~40 µs). The 80–400 µs
  range was already 2–10× linear and still undershot. Fixed
  per-operation overhead — software-walk decode, level/grain
  asserts, a colder TCG trace once the 32k loop is gone — does
  not scale down with the count. Finding 10 was the same error
  in miniature: paper costs counted the operation, not the
  call/TCG floor.
- **Consequences:** future phase projections pad more than a
  linear remainder, or they are ranges wide enough that "over
  range" is the expected miss and only the falsify-if line is
  load-bearing. Threats item 14 is this finding, not a note.
  It does not change the 5% bar (that bar is measured, not
  estimated). The report's methodology section states this as
  prose (the transferable lesson about emulated systems), not
  only as this entry or as threats item 14.
- Revisit trigger: a fourth pre-registered small-phase range
  that lands *low* would break the sign and reopen this.

## D-0070: E3w→E4 is hypothesized to be an E3w anchoring artifact
- Date: 2026-08-18 — Status: **confirmed** (bench-host pcap pass,
  2026-08-18, read-only over T4.6 and both D-0068 campaigns, zero
  new boots; the one prediction that failed as written — the
  W + D_fin reconstruction — is a profile-independent constant
  explained and closed by D-0071)
- **Decision (hypothesis):** the open ~31 ms fast / ~93 ms safe
  E3w→E4 term is not host-side post-publish delivery. It is the
  time an already-accepted hostfwd connection waits for the guest
  to become reachable, mislabeled by E3w's construction.
  `scripts/bench.py::e0_to_e3w_ns` computes
  `first_connect + pcap(SYN/ACK→HTTP)` and its docstring assumes
  "first-connect (≈ SYN/ACK)". With hostfwd that approximation
  fails: `connect()` succeeds at QEMU's host-side accept — the
  listener is up during QEMU startup, before the machine runs —
  while the guest SYN/ACK on the netdev happens only after
  firmware + boot-to-net-init. Everything between accept and the
  guest SYN/ACK lands in "E3w→E4". True publish→client delivery
  is hypothesized sub-millisecond in both profiles.
- **Evidence already in recorded CSVs (report-grade data, no new
  runs):**
  1. `e0_to_first_connect_ns` is profile-independent (fast
     18.53 ms, safe 18.55 ms) while serving-readiness differs by
     ~70 ms — connect success cannot be gated on the guest.
     `attempts` ≈ 17 at 1 ms cadence: refused until listener-up.
  2. Rung deltas partition exactly as the construction predicts.
     Savings in phases *before* net-init move "E3w→E4":
     freeze→T4.4 `frame_init` −7.06 ms predicted, −7.37 ms
     observed; T4.4→T4.6 paging −2.72 ms predicted, −2.83 ms
     observed. Savings *after* net-init move E0→E3w:
     freeze→T4.4 `accounting` −4.77 ms predicted, E0→E3w moved
     −5.08 ms; T4.4→T4.6 had no post-net savings and E0→E3w
     moved −0.10 ms.
  3. The affine form E3w→E4 ≈ const + boot-to-net-init explains
     the 3× safe/fast ratio against the ~12× boot ratio, and the
     D-0068 null: there was never tens of ms of post-publish host
     work for a yield to reorder.
- **Wire-level method check (this KVM pod, one release+fast-boot
  gate boot; magnitudes not report-grade, mechanism only):** the
  pcap's first frame is slirp broadcasting an ARP request for
  10.0.2.15 (sender 10.0.2.2) — the queued hostfwd SYN trying to
  resolve the guest at client-connect time. It goes unanswered for
  28.5 ms until the guest's first TX (its gateway ARP request at
  net-init); the queued SYN flushes 67 µs later; SYN/ACK, GET
  (queued since accept), response. ACK of the 92 B response:
  +36 µs after the HTTP frame. Client FIN (client received the
  body and closed): +212 µs. Accept-to-SYN/ACK wait: 29.3 ms =
  ~99% of what the E3w construction would call "E3w→E4" on this
  boot. Guest-clock vs pcap-clock rate agreement on the same
  intervals: ~1%. Incidentally: the guest ACKs the client's FIN
  19.4 ms late — it is inside the D-0068 `wfi` + PHASE dump,
  after E4, exactly where the dump no longer matters.
- **Pre-registered discriminator (bench host; read-only over
  already-recorded per-trial pcaps of T4.6 and both D-0068
  campaigns; zero new boots, no harness change):**
  `just d0070-pcap-pass` (`scripts/d0070-pcap-pass.py`) `git show`s
  the three CSV objects and reads `results/trials/<batch>/…/qemu.pcap`.
  Missing pcaps fail closed — they are gitignored; do not substitute
  a cloud-pod leftover. Per trial, on the single pcap clock:
  - `W` := t(first guest SYN/ACK) − t(first slirp ARP request for
    10.0.2.15) — accept-to-handshake wait.
    (`arp.opcode==1 && arp.src.proto_ipv4==10.0.2.2 &&
    arp.dst.proto_ipv4==10.0.2.15`; `tcp.srcport==80 &&
    tcp.flags==0x012`.)
  - `D_ack` := t(first pure ACK from slirp acknowledging the 92 B
    payload+FIN) − t(HTTP frame) — delivery to the host stack.
  - `D_fin` := t(first client FIN toward :80) − t(HTTP frame) —
    upper bound on publish→client-recv (the bench client closes
    after `recv`; D-0068 alternative 3).
  - Crosscheck: pcap(SYN/ACK→HTTP) vs guest
    `rdtime(E3g − established)` within ~0.3 ms (clock-rate sanity).
  **Predictions (padded per D-0069):** `D_fin` ≤ 5 ms and
  safe/fast ratio < 2; `W` ≈ E3w→E4 − `D_fin` within ~1 ms in
  both profiles; `W_safe − W_fast` ≈ 61.5 ms ≈ the
  boot-to-net-init difference. **Falsify the hypothesis if**
  `D_fin` ≥ 10 ms in fast, or `D_fin` scales ≥ 2× with profile.
- **Outcome meanings:**
  1. As predicted → E3w→E4 was mislabeled guest-boot wait; amend
     D-0066 ("largest host-side term" was mostly our own boot,
     already counted once, correctly, in E0→E4); retire E3w→E4 as
     a remainder metric; report true delivery as `D_fin`
     (generated); no QEMU/slirp mechanism to chase; D-0068's yield
     stays on principle.
  2. `D_fin` large and profile-scaling → real post-publish host
     delay; TCG/main-loop contention returns as candidate; next
     discriminators: a yield bracketing the full gap, then
     main-loop tracing.
  3. Intermediate → partition the term: `W` vs `D_fin`, per
     profile, per rung.
- **Alternatives considered as the mechanism, and why they do not
  fit the three facts:** TCG translation-cache state (affects
  guest-side intervals, which live inside the pcap-relative term
  E3w subtracts out; cannot scale a host-clock gap with boot
  length). QEMU main-loop timer coalescing and slirp polling
  (sub-ms, boot-independent). Host TCP delayed-ACK / Nagle on the
  loopback hostfwd path (single 92 B data+FIN push; host stack
  ACKs immediately — 36 µs measured on the pod; constant, not
  boot-scaling). Client `recv` scheduling (sub-ms; bounded by
  `D_fin`). None predicts the rung-delta partition in evidence
  item 2; the anchoring artifact predicts it exactly.
- **Cross-system consequence (rules on the Linux row, whichever
  way the pcap pass lands):** cross-system tables carry **no
  E3w-derived columns** (E0→E3w, E3w→E4). Under the hypothesis,
  Linux's "E3w→E4" would be its boot-to-listening time in
  disguise — hundreds of ms of pure confound. E0→E4 is two direct
  client-clock stamps and is not confounded: Linux's longer boot
  is counted once, correctly. E0→first-connect under hostfwd
  measures QEMU listener-up (~18.5 ms, guest-independent) and
  becomes a same-QEMU **control** column, not a comparison — if
  Linux's differs, that flags the run, not the system. Whimbrel's
  own decomposition may keep E3w with the construction stated
  (threats item 12). One stated asymmetry: SYN delivery waits for
  the guest's first wire TX (slirp learns the MAC from any guest
  frame), so a stack that stays wire-silent until after listening
  defers its own handshake by up to one ARP exchange — µs-class,
  stated, not corrected.
- **Outcome (bench-host pcap pass, 2026-08-18; generated exhibit
  `report/exhibits/d0070-pcap.md`, medians over n=60 per config per
  campaign):** `D_fin` 63–155 µs across all six campaign-configs
  (prediction ≤ 5 ms; falsify line was ≥ 10 ms). Safe/fast `D_fin`
  ratio 0.41–0.91 — real post-publish delivery does not scale with
  profile at all (falsify line was ≥ 2×). `D_ack` 24–40 µs.
  `W_safe − W_fast` = 61.40 / 61.84 / 61.65 ms per campaign against
  the predicted ≈ 61.5 ms. The clock-rate crosscheck
  |pcap(SYN/ACK→HTTP) − guest(E3g−established)| was 143–145 µs fast
  (within the ~0.3 ms note) and ~0.58 ms safe (over it; stated, not
  load-bearing — the safe interval spans ~10.9 ms of post-handshake
  boot). The reconstruction line failed as written: per-trial
  `(W + D_fin) − (E3w→E4)` was −6.70 to −7.00 ms in **all six**
  cells (IQRs under ~1 ms), a constant that does not scale with
  profile. That residual is not a boot term; it is the pre-ARP
  QEMU-startup slice, diagnosed and closed in D-0071. With it, the
  ~31 ms fast / ~93 ms safe "host-side" term decomposes completely:
  QEMU startup remainder (~6.8 ms) + accepted-connection wait for
  the guest (W) + sub-ms delivery (`D_fin`). Outcome meaning 1
  applies: D-0066 amended, E3w→E4 retired as a reported metric,
  true delivery reported as `D_fin` (generated), no QEMU/slirp
  mechanism to chase, D-0068's yield stays on principle.
- Revisit trigger: any harness change that re-anchors E3w
  (D-0067 territory, bench host owns it).

## D-0071: The D-0070 residual is the pre-ARP QEMU-startup slice
- Date: 2026-08-18 — Status: accepted (mechanism demonstrated on the
  pod with a one-clock per-boot accounting that closes to well under
  the pre-registered 1 ms; the bench-host magnitude is derived
  arithmetic from report-grade artifacts)
- **Decision:** the −6.70 to −7.00 ms reconstruction residual in the
  D-0070 pcap pass is the slice of QEMU startup between the hostfwd
  listener coming up and the main loop going live. Name it **S**.
  Algebra first: in `residual = (W + D_fin) − (E3w→E4)` the
  pcap-internal SYN/ACK→HTTP interval cancels exactly, leaving
  `residual = pcap(ARP→FIN) − host(first_connect→E4)` — a difference
  of two same-trial spans, immune to clock-rate error. A negative
  constant therefore lives at one of the two ends: either the ARP is
  emitted after first-connect (front) or the client FIN lands before
  E4 (back). The back end is µs by construction:
  `scripts/bench-client.py` stamps E4 at the first `recv` chunk and
  `close()`s immediately after the body — measured client-side
  close-after-E4 is ~5 µs. The front end is where QEMU startup can
  hide: `first_connect` stamps when the **host kernel** completes the
  client handshake into the listen backlog — that happens the moment
  `listen()` exists during netdev init, with QEMU still mid-startup
  and no `accept()` call required — while slirp only services the
  queued connection (and emits the ARP that starts W's clock) after
  machine realize, firmware + kernel ROM load, and `vm_start` put the
  main loop in charge. S is that remaining-startup slice: host-native
  work, profile-independent, constant per host and QEMU build.
- **Evidence (pod, mechanism-grade, not report numbers):**
  1. **Campaign-shape replication on leftover data:** the four
     Aug 16 pod batches (264 trials; `client.json` spans + pcap
     spans; no e0 needed) give residual medians −7.6 to −8.1 ms,
     profile-independent while W differs by ~60 ms — same shape as
     the bench host's −6.8 ms on different hardware and QEMU.
  2. **One-clock split:** ten instrumented boots (5 per profile)
     polling the pcap file size on the client's own monotonic clock.
     filter-dump writes each frame as captured, so the first size
     transition past the 24-byte global header timestamps the ARP's
     capture. front := t(first frame write) − first_connect was
     4.6–5.8 ms, and **per boot, front + residual = +0.05 to
     +0.32 ms** — the front slice accounts for the entire residual
     to within the µs-scale FIN tail, in both profiles, and tracks
     the residual's boot-to-boot jitter. The header write itself
     lands within ~0.1 ms of first-connect: listener-up and
     filter-dump attach are the same startup phase (netdev init).
  3. **Late-connect control:** three boots with the client starting
     300 ms after spawn (main loop live, guest already serving).
     slirp forwards the SYN 60–160 µs after connect; the full
     request completes in ~2 ms. No fixed per-accept cost — the
     slice exists only when the connection lands during startup.
  4. **The epoch route is dead, as recorded:** filter-dump's
     absolute pcap timestamps differ from Python `time.time_ns()`
     by −30 to −846 ms *varying per boot* (pod QEMU 8.2.2) —
     confirming the D-0043 / `bench.py` docstring finding and
     ruling out any `pcap_epoch − e0_wall` diagnostic.
- **Bench-host magnitude:** S = −residual − ε ≈ 6.6–7.0 ms across
  the six campaign-configs (ε = FIN-after-E4 tail, ~0.1 ms). This is
  arithmetic on the report-grade CSVs and pcaps combined with the
  mechanism above; S itself is a per-host constant and is never a
  report number.
- **Alternatives considered as the residual's mechanism:**
  clock-rate drift (rejected: the residual is constant across a
  31 ms fast span and a 93 ms safe span; a rate error scales with
  span; measured rate agreement is ~1%). Client-side lag between
  FIN and E4 (rejected: E4 precedes the FIN and the close tail is
  ~5 µs; the front accounts per boot). A fixed slirp per-accept
  cost (rejected by the late-connect control). ARP emission gated
  on guest RX readiness (rejected: the ARP is pcap frame 1, written
  long before the guest's first TX).
- **Consequences:**
  1. E3w→E4 decomposes with nothing left over:
     **S (~6.8 ms QEMU startup) + W (guest boot wait) + D_recv
     (≤ `D_fin`, 63–155 µs)**. No unexplained constant remains under
     any name. D-0066 is amended; E3w→E4 is retired as a reported
     metric; delivery is reported as `D_fin` (generated).
  2. **Methodology finding:** a derived metric silently
     double-counted guest boot — and QEMU's own startup — under a
     host-sounding name. It survived a pre-registered audit and four
     measurement campaigns (freeze, T4.4, T4.6, D-0068), and was
     caught only because it moved with rungs it should not have
     (D-0070 evidence item 2). The corollary to D-0069: an
     unexplained constant must not keep a plausible-sounding name;
     "host-side remainder" was doing the work that "measured
     delivery" could not. Threats item 16 carries this.
  3. **Harness fix:** the interface is the **Bench-host spec
     (D-0071)** section of `results/README.md`. In short: drop
     `e0_to_e3w_ns`; record per-trial `w_ns`, `d_ack_ns`, `d_fin_ns`
     from the D-0070 filters on one pcap clock; keep
     `e0_to_first_connect_ns` as a same-QEMU control (a deviation
     fails the run, it is not a system difference); put S in the
     batch header, not in every `runs.csv` row. No cross-system
     table may carry an E3w-derived column. Historical git objects
     keep the old schema; do not rewrite them. The T4.8 trial-time
     work lands the writer in `scripts/bench.py`; the dedicated
     host executes it (the cloud build VM does not run `just bench`).
- Revisit trigger: a bench-host instrumented mechanism check (the
  pcap-write poll, ~10 boots) if anyone wants S measured rather than
  derived there; or any QEMU/host change on the bench machine, which
  may move S and with it nothing else.

## D-0072: Label Linux's 327 ms hole on the same Image; do not add a sixth arm
- Date: 2026-08-18 — Status: accepted
- **Decision:** the Linux boot decomposition exhibit is generated
  from the T4.8 instrumented serial of `Image-trimmed` (printk
  gaps, `/init` stamps, unmeasured prefix). It is not a
  per-initcall ranking. Naming the 327 ms anonymous gap is a
  **diagnostic boot**, not a campaign arm: the same
  `Image-trimmed` (MANIFEST hash), cmdline =
  instrumented MANIFEST line plus `ignore_loglevel`, one boot, no
  N-trial, no `runs.csv` row, never a cross-system table cell.
  Addresses from `initcall 0x… returned … after N usecs` are
  resolved offline against `System.map` from that Image's build.
  Durations on that boot are UART-inflated labels for the hole;
  they do not replace the 327 ms measured under `loglevel=7`.
- **Initcall_debug produced nothing on the instrumented arm. Two
  factors, this order:**
  1. **`loglevel=7` filters `KERN_DEBUG`.** Linux 6.18 prints
     initcall_debug via `printk(KERN_DEBUG "calling  %pS …")` /
     `"initcall %pS returned %d after %lld usecs"`
     (`init/main.c` `trace_initcall_*_cb`). Console emits levels
     strictly below `console_loglevel`. Debug is 7, so
     `loglevel=7` is **necessary and sufficient** for zero
     initcall entries in the T4.8 serial. `ignore_loglevel` (or
     `loglevel=8`) is what makes those lines exist.
  2. **`# CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not set`** (`linux-trimmed.fragment`
     line 71) affects **names only**. `%pS` without kallsyms still
     prints the pointer. The same T4.8 log already does, at a
     visible level: `PM: Calling 0xffffffff800614ec`. Kallsyms
     would turn that into a symbol; it would not have created the
     missing `KERN_DEBUG` lines.
- **Alternatives considered:** a sixth campaign arm, trimmed +
  `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y`, instrumented (rejected: different Image than
  the published trimmed row — the quiet-vs-instrumented asymmetry
  D-0062 already refused, moved into kconfig; kallsyms without
  raising loglevel still prints nothing, so the arm would have to
  change the binary *and* the cmdline). Fabricating an E2 from
  OpenSBI line count or from `W − accept` (rejected: D-0062;
  mixed-clock remainder is the D-0071 shape). Typing printk table
  cells (rejected: D-0064; generate from `git show` of the serial
  pin).
- **Rationale:** a kernel trimmed this hard cannot be fully
  instrumented by its own debug facility. That is a finding about
  minimal-kernel measurement, not a mistake in the T4.8 setup.
  Labeling on the same binary keeps the decomposition honest;
  ranking from a fatter Image would describe work we did not
  compare.
- **Consequences:** bench-host spec in `results/README.md`
  (D-0072). Exhibit `report/exhibits/linux-decomposition.md` from
  the T4.8 serial pin (`d705ecb`) plus the diagnostic label pin
  (`93ab617`). `just linux-initcall-label` is the diagnostic
  writer; the cloud build VM fail-closes without the bench-host
  artifacts. The labeled
  table annotates gap 1; it does not grow a sixth E0→E4 row.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — labels committed):** hole rank 1 is
  `trace_eval_sync` (222.6 ms UART-inflated, 68% of the T4.8
  327.24 ms cell). Ranks 2–29 combined are under 20 ms. Full-file,
  `of_platform_serial_driver_init` is 163.0 ms UART-inflated;
  `virtio_net_driver_init` + `virtio_mmio_init` are 4.9 ms
  UART-inflated. Those microseconds label the 327 ms cell; they
  do not replace it. `trace_eval_sync` is the eval-map flush
  (`late_initcall_sync` / `destroy_workqueue`); no tracing
  consumer is running. `FTRACE` is a missed trim (see D-0062
  amendment). `CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM` is a keep: the 82.5×
  gap vs `serial8250_init` is DT-probe vs core-register. The
  comparison claim is named subsystems a single-purpose kernel
  never runs, not "Linux is slower."

## D-0073: Act on the FTRACE miss; T4.8b is before/after, not a silent replace
- Date: 2026-08-18 — Status: accepted (projection pre-registered;
  bench-host rebuild + campaign not yet run)
- **Decision:** rebuild `Image-trimmed` with `# CONFIG_FTRACE is
  not set` plus the other non-EXPERT (and already-EXPERT-visible)
  leftovers named below, then re-run the five-arm campaign as
  **T4.8b**. Keep T4.8 (`ffb7ac7`, serial `d705ecb`, labels
  `93ab617`) as the pre-FTRACE result. Do not retarget those
  pins. The finding is the before/after: a diagnostic pass named
  a cost, we removed it, here's what it bought. PLAN T4.9 remains
  the Unikraft spike; this is still the T4.8 Linux-baseline
  family.
- **Why now:** the trimmed row is a good-faith floor attempt.
  Leaving a named, non-EXPERT-gated symbol that accounts for the
  largest identified cost undercuts that claim. "We ran out of
  patience" is not an answer.
- **Fragment sweep (the cloud build VM has no copy of the trimmed
  `.config`; candidates
  reconstructed from the T4.8 printk, the D-0072 label file, the
  riscv `defconfig`, and Linux 6.18.7 Kconfig).** Unset if (a) y
  on the T4.8 Image, (b) the prompt is not EXPERT-gated *or*
  EXPERT is already on and the leftover is obviously unused, (c)
  a static musl HTTP `/init` over virtio-mmio does not need it.
  One pass: FTRACE dominated a gap; the printk also named NFS,
  9p, USB, ALSA, SDHCI, mousedev, HugeTLB, audit, RPC, ACPI,
  goldfish RTC.

  Non-EXPERT (the FTRACE class):
  - `FTRACE` — the named miss (`menuconfig`, `default y if
    DEBUG_KERNEL`)
  - `NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS` — parent of NFS / 9P_FS / SUNRPC;
    not the parent of `NET_9P` (see amendment)
  - `NET_9P` — 9p transport under `NET` (T4.8b 3b miss)
  - `DNS_RESOLVER` — NFS v4 leftover; prompt under networking
  - `NLS` — FAT/ISO leftover; Native language support menu
  - `MTD` — `MTD_BLOCK` leftover; MTD core
  - `DAX` — PMEM leftover; direct-access menu
  - `IP_PNP` — NFS-root leftover; `/init` does `SIOCSIFADDR`
  - `FHANDLE` / `OVERLAY_FS` / `EXPORTFS` — remaining
    selectors of the fs-export helper (fourth pass). Unsetting
    `EXPORTFS` alone leaves `=m`.
  - `KEYS` — D-0073 originally said keep; superseded after
    `NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS` removed the only selector (`NFS_V4`).
    `/init` never touches a keyring.
  - `MEMFD_CREATE`, `EEPROM_93CX6`, `EXTCON`,
    `INPUT_FF_MEMLESS`, `HID_SUPPORT`, `REALTEK_PHY`,
    `SPI_MEM`, `NETWORK_SECMARK`, `SECURITYFS` — same
    non-reversing-select walk; only selectors now absent
  - `USB_SUPPORT` — USB / usbhid
  - `SOUND` — ALSA ("No soundcards found.")
  - `MMC` — SDHCI
  - `INPUT_MOUSEDEV`, `INPUT_MOUSE` — mousedev / psmouse
  - `HID`
  - `HUGETLBFS`
  - `AUDIT`
  - `BPF_SYSCALL` — hole full of `bpf_*` initcalls; `/init` never
    `bpf()`
  - `ACPI` — "Interpreter disabled"; DT boot
  - `PNP` — "PnP ACPI: disabled"
  - `LEGACY_PTYS` — default y, not EXPERT-gated
  - `RTC_CLASS` — goldfish_rtc registered as rtc0 and set the
    wall clock; `/init` uses `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
  - `WATCHDOG` — `watchdog_init` 8.0 ms UART-inflated

  EXPERT-gated, EXPERT already y, same "obviously unused":
  - `UNIX98_PTYS` — `pty_init` 33.8 ms UART-inflated

  Keeps unchanged: serial (`SERIAL_8250`, `SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM`),
  virtio-mmio + virtio-net, IPv4 TCP, initramfs, `DEVTMPFS`,
  `FUTEX`, `MODULES=y`, `DEBUG_KERNEL` (cutting the child, not
  the parent default). `of_platform_serial_driver_init` vs
  `serial8250_init` is core registration versus DT probe of
  `10000000.serial` (82.5×, UART-inflated); still a keep.

  Deferred this pass (named so they are not found one at a time):
  VT, DEBUG_FS (likely already off with SYSFS), FB, PINCTRL
  (virt DT; do not discover a no-boot on the campaign), I2C /
  SPI / GPIO (`gpio_keys` was 86 µs UART-inflated), thermal /
  cpuidle (idle path), LSM (SELinux / AppArmor; likely already
  n). Second-look the actual `trimmed.config` before T4.8b; if a
  T4.8-printk leftover is still y and unused, amend and rebuild
  then, not after N-trials.
- **Projection (quiet-row `trimmed` E0→E4), pre-registered before
  T4.8b runs.** T4.8 trimmed median is 759.79 ms (IQR 2.61 ms).
  `trace_eval_sync` is 222.6 ms **UART-inflated** on the
  `ignore_loglevel` boot. D-0069 applies: do not treat that
  duration as a quiet-row saving.

  Named fixed component mixed into the 222.6 ms: ignore_loglevel
  UART (console drain of this initcall's `KERN_DEBUG` lines and
  any nested printk) plus TCG occupancy from the rest of that
  noisy boot. That component is **not** in quiet E0→E4
  (`loglevel=0`). The eval-map walk itself is real TCG compute;
  the split is unmeasured (quiet row hides `initcall_debug`).

  Refused point prediction: 759.79 − 222.6 = 537.19 ms. That
  subtracts a diagnostic wall time from a quiet median.

  The other unsets add more real work (NFS, ALSA, mousedev, PTY,
  RTC, watchdog, …) whose diagnostic usecs are similarly
  UART-inflated. Do not sum those usecs onto 222.6 and subtract
  from 759.79 either.

  **Orientation range (not a falsifier):** T4.8b trimmed E0→E4
  **540–740 ms**. The low end is "diagnostic usecs were almost
  all real compute" (D-0069-unpadded, likely too fast). The high
  end is "almost all of 222.6 was UART, other unsets also small
  on the quiet row." Expected: a clearly detectable drop vs
  759.79, not 222.6 ms on the nose.

  **Falsifiers (load-bearing):**
  1. T4.8b trimmed E0→E4 ≥ T4.8 trimmed 759.79 ms — no
     improvement. The named miss was UART-only on the quiet row,
     or the unset did not stick. Diagnose `trimmed.config`
     (`FTRACE` still y?) before any "we removed 222 ms" claim.
     Do not publish a saving.
  2. Existing D-0062 tripwire: T4.8b trimmed ≥ T4.8b stock.
  3. `Image-trimmed` sha256 still `fe821d1d…` — rebuild skipped.
  4. `Image-stock` sha256 ≠ `fa0f4315…` — stock moved; T4.8 is
     no longer the before. Restore the T4.8 `Image-stock`; do
     not rebuild it (the version string is dated).
  5. SYN-grid / RST / first-connect / `LINUX INIT OK` as T4.8.
- **Consequences:** spec in `results/README.md` (D-0073).
  `linux-build` refuses to reuse `Image-trimmed` when the
  fragment sha changed, and fails if stock hash moved or trimmed
  hash did not. `just report-exhibits` keeps generating the T4.8
  Linux decomposition from `d705ecb` + `93ab617`; those pins do
  not follow HEAD. T4.8b CSVs get a new pin and a before/after
  exhibit when they exist. Optional post-T4.8b
  `ignore_loglevel` boot confirms `trace_eval_sync` is gone; it
  is still not a sixth arm. The T4.8 hole window
  (`dns_resolver` → `clk-disable`) may move or vanish; do not
  retarget the T4.8 exhibit to a new window.
- Revisit when T4.8b numbers exist, or if a merge-override forces
  a fragment annotation (ACPI/HID are the likely stickers).
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — merge_config gate split):** T4.8b
  `linux-build` failed closed on `CONFIG_RTC_CLASS` with
  `Value of CONFIG_RTC_CLASS is redefined by fragment`. That
  message means the fragment overrode stock — which is what
  every trim line does. The gate treated it like a dependency
  refusal and required a comment containing the bare symbol
  name. Intent notes counted, so thirty other redefined lines
  passed; `RTC_CLASS` (note said `RTC:`) did not. WATCHDOG
  would have been next.

  Was: `check_merge_warnings` aborted on `redefined by
  fragment` / `redundant by fragment` unless some `# …`
  comment matched `\bSYM\b` (the unset line itself skipped).
  `not in final .config` was ignored here; `requested_vs_final`
  was the only survival check.

  Now: redefined/redundant are informational.
  `not in final .config` where the symbol survived requires
  `# merge-override SYM:` or abort. Vanished-after-unset
  (requested unset, actual empty) is success. Intent notes are
  not overrides. Classifier: `scripts/linux-merge-warnings.py`
  (selftest covers the RTC_CLASS false positive). The
  `RTC_CLASS` intent note now names `RTC_CLASS`; that is
  readability, not the gate.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — three not-in-final cases):** the
  split over-fired the other way: 300+ FAILs, almost all
  stock `=y` symbols that vanished because we unset their
  parent. merge_config diffs concatenated stock+fragment
  against the final `.config`, so `SCSI_MOD` / `NFS_FS` /
  `USB_XHCI_HCD` / `SND_PCM` / `RTC_LIB` / `SECURITY_SELINUX`
  report as "requested =y, final absent" even though none of
  them are in the fragment.

  Three cases, discriminated on fragment membership:
  1. fragment unset → final y — survival, annotate or abort
  2. fragment unset → final absent — menu vanished, success
  3. requested =y → final absent, **not** in the fragment —
     dependent drop, success, informational (count, not 300
     FAIL lines)

  A dependent drop that removes something we need is a keep
  failure, not a cascade to annotate. Block 3c asserts serial /
  virtio / IPv4 TCP / initramfs / `DEVTMPFS` / `FUTEX` are y
  on the final `.config`. Selftest covers all three cases plus
  the keeps check.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — split leftovers):** T4.8b block 3
  was clean; block 3b caught `CONFIG_NET_9P: final y`. Unsetting
  `NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS` removed `9P_FS` (sourced under that
  `if` in `fs/Kconfig`) but not `NET_9P` (`menuconfig` in
  `net/9p/Kconfig`, sourced from `net/Kconfig` next to
  wireless). The filesystem is gone; its protocol layer is
  still built in. `p9_virtio_init` was 31 µs on the D-0072
  boot. Fragment unsets `NET_9P` with a note naming the split.
  Children (`NET_9P_FD`, `NET_9P_VIRTIO`) stay out of the
  fragment; 3b still requires they are not y.

  Same shape, walked from the T4.8 Image initcalls + riscv
  `defconfig` + Linux 6.18 Kconfig (the cloud build VM has no
  post-rebuild `trimmed.config`). Fragment unsets the
  other-parent survivor; 3b lists both sides:

  - `DNS_RESOLVER` — NFS v4 `select`s it; prompt is under
    networking options, not the network-filesystems menu.
    T4.8 hole started here.
  - `NLS` — FAT/ISO live under `if BLOCK`; USB `select`s
    the NLS core. Native language support is a different
    parent (`fs/nls/Kconfig`). T4.8: `init_nls_cp437`.
  - `MTD` — `MTD_BLOCK` depends on `BLOCK`; the MTD core
    does not. T4.8: `init_mtd`, `spi_nor`, CFI.
  - `DAX` — `LIBNVDIMM` depends on `BLK_DEV` (gone with
    `BLOCK`); `menuconfig DAX` is a different menu and the
    prompt keeps it y. T4.8: `dax_core_init`.
  - `IP_PNP` — kernel IP autoconfig exists to serve NFS
    root / diskless boot (`ROOT_NFS depends on IP_PNP`).
    The prompt sits under IPv4. `/init` does `SIOCSIFADDR`.
    T4.8: `ip_auto_config`.

  `SUNRPC` is sourced *inside* `if NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS`, so
  it should already have vanished; 3b lists it so a future
  split cannot hide. Do not unset `FAILOVER` /
  `NET_FAILOVER` (`VIRTIO_NET` `select`s it). Do not unset
  `FILE_LOCKING`.
- **Amendment (2026-08-18 — non-reversing select, one pass):**
  block 3b then caught `EXPORTFS: final y`. It is a bare
  `tristate` in `fs/Kconfig` with no menu. `NFSD` `select`s it,
  but `NFSD` was never y on this defconfig. The live selectors
  were `FHANDLE` (EXPERT prompt, `default y`) and
  `OVERLAY_FS=m`. Unsetting `EXPORTFS` alone would have left
  it `=m`. Fragment unsets `FHANDLE`, `OVERLAY_FS`, and
  `EXPORTFS` together.

  Same walk, remaining `=y` whose only selectors were now
  absent (reconstructed `riscv defconfig` + fragment +
  `olddefconfig`): `KEYS`, `MEMFD_CREATE`, `EEPROM_93CX6`,
  `EXTCON`, `INPUT_FF_MEMLESS`, `HID_SUPPORT`, `REALTEK_PHY`,
  `SPI_MEM`, `NETWORK_SECMARK`, `SECURITYFS`. All 13 go in
  this pass.

  `KEYS`: D-0073 originally said keep; superseded after
  `NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS` removed the only selector (`NFS_V4`).
  `/init` never touches a keyring. The reversal is in the
  fragment note, not silent.

  The shape has a name: **non-reversing select**. `select`
  does not unset the target when the selector goes. Seven
  exemplars on this Image: `NET_9P`, `DNS_RESOLVER`, `NLS`,
  `MTD`, `DAX`, `IP_PNP`, `EXPORTFS`. Finding them one 3b
  miss at a time cost three rebuilds; the fourth pass
  enumerated live `select` edges against remaining `=y`
  instead.

## D-0074: The T4.8b stall is a lost guest ARP solicit; measure the rate first
- Date: 2026-08-19 — Status: accepted (mechanism reproduced on the
  bench host under D-0055 controls; rate experiment run — 25 events
  in 550 boots, **not runnable as-is**; the `/init` change is
  authorised by item 3 and specified in D-0075)
- **Decision:**
  1. **Name the mechanism.** The T4.8b `20260818T143032Z-1`
     trimmed/02 stall is **not** an egress fault. The guest's first
     ARP solicit never reached the TX ring; the guest's own `neigh`
     retransmit re-sent it ~1.03 s later, past slirp's ~1 s
     ARP-pending drop, which snapped the queued hostfwd SYN to
     slirp's ~6 s RTO.
  2. **Measure the rate before deciding runnability.** Run the
     pre-registered 5000-boot experiment below on the bench host.
     No T4.8b campaign starts before that verdict.
  3. **If events appear (k ≥ 3): shorten the heal, do not hide it.**
     Set the guest's `neigh` retransmit to ~50 ms in `/init` so the
     loss heals two decades below slirp's cliff. The event still
     happens at the same rate, still shows on the wire, and becomes
     a countable ~+50 ms outlier instead of a destroyed trial.
  4. **Log the signature permanently.** `bench.py` records the
     per-trial loss signature on every Linux trial, passively. Event
     trials are **kept and published**, never dropped — dropping
     them would be selection on the outcome.
  5. **Validate, then run T4.8b.** A second 5000-boot run on the new
     cpio must show zero cliff crossings before the campaign.
  6. **Do not patch slirp's ARP-pending drop.** It is the detector.
     Removing it converts a loud abort into a silent ~1 s inflation
     of `W`, which fuses boot and delivery (threats item 19).
  7. **Do not retry until a batch passes.** The abort policy below
     is fixed in advance.
- **Evidence (bench host, mechanism-grade; not report numbers).**
  D-0055 controls in force (`governor=performance`, `smt=off`,
  `boost=0`, `virt=none`, steal 0), current `Image-trimmed`
  (MANIFEST `1bf91509…`), campaign argv and early-started
  `bench-client`. Per boot: wall-ns-stamped serial, QEMU-internal
  `-msg timestamp=on` trace of `virtio_queue_notify` /
  `virtqueue_pop` / `virtio_notify`, a 0.5 ms pcap-size poller
  joining frame writes to wall time (the D-0071 method), PSI, steal.
  100 boots in two runs; one event.

  On the failing boot, relative to the QEMU spawn:

  | t | event |
  |---|---|
  | +0.217 s | `DRIVER_OK` probe kicks (n=0,1,2) |
  | +0.262–0.269 s | RX kick, three ctrl-vq (n=2) completions |
  | +0.2695 s | `/init` announce `sendto` returns (guest-mono 156.57 ms) |
  | +0.2710 s | `READY` |
  | +0.2710–1.2980 s | **nothing** — no trace, serial or pcap write |
  | +1.297985 s | `virtio_queue_notify` n=1 |
  | +1.298000 s | TX pop (+15 µs); frame in the pcap +89 µs later |
  | +1.298015 s | RX pop — slirp's ARP reply |
  | +6.29 s | slirp's SYN retry; the request then completes normally |

  Four facts put the hold on the **guest** side of the boundary:
  1. **No TX kick exists in the hole.** On every clean boot the n=1
     kick and pop appear ~10 ms *before* `READY` (the ARP leaves
     inside `sendto`). Here the kick is not late — it does not exist
     until +1.298. Kicks travel by ioeventfd (level-triggered); QEMU
     cannot lose one for a second.
  2. **Exactly one guest ARP request on the wire** — also one on
     clean boots. `virtio_net_flush_tx` drains the ring: had solicit
     #1 been sitting in the avail ring un-kicked, the wake would
     have popped two frames and the capture would show two ARP
     requests. It shows one. Solicit #1 never entered the ring.
  3. **QEMU serviced the wake in 15 µs** (kick→pop), 104 µs
     kick→pcap write. The main loop was healthy throughout.
  4. **The resume instant is the guest's own retransmit deadline.**
     `ftx − announce = 1028.6 ms`. Linux `neigh` default
     `retrans_time` is 1000 ms; this Image is `CONFIG_HZ=250` with
     `NO_HZ_IDLE`, so a 250-jiffy `timer_list` lands in wheel level
     1 (8-jiffy = 32 ms granularity) and expires in [1000, 1032) ms.
     1028.6 ms is in band. The guest sat in WFI with that timer the
     only thing armed; its expiry woke QEMU.

  Host-level confounds are excluded on the same boot: PSI io-some
  1.4 ms over a 1298 ms window (0.11%), steal 0, `vmstat` showing
  99–100% idle and zero block IO across the hole. PSI **cpu**-some
  looks 3× a clean boot as a raw delta and is 1.28% as a rate,
  *below* the clean-boot 1.4–2.3% — the raw delta is window-length
  bias, the event boot's window being ~15× a clean one. The
  suspected writeback trigger is also excluded: the 8 GiB `dd`
  finished 97 s before the run's first boot and 108 s before the
  event.
- **The campaign trial is this event, not an analogue.** `/init`
  stamps, campaign `20260818T143032Z-1` trimmed/02 vs the bench-host
  reproduction: listen 144.868 / 144.649 ms, ifup 151.775 / 151.592,
  announce 156.749 / 156.574, ready 158.205 / 158.032, accept
  6215.432 / 6215.231 — every stamp within 0.22 ms. First guest TX
  1.263389 s / 1.264267 s (pcap-relative). Exactly one guest ARP
  request in both.
- **A margin predictor falls out, and it is continuous.** Define
  **margin** = announce wall instant − the last virtio ctrl-vq
  completion before it. Over the 100 recorded boots: clean margins
  12.28–12.69 ms in both runs; the failing boot **0.199 ms**. One
  boot sits between — margin 3.917 ms, no loss, but its ARP reached
  the wire +1.009 ms *after* `sendto` returned instead of the normal
  −8.4 ms: delayed ~9.4 ms, healed without a retransmit. So this is
  not a binary event but a race whose margin is measurable on
  **every** boot. That is what makes a cheap rate experiment worth
  running, and it gives a per-boot risk observable that does not
  depend on an event firing.

  The exact in-guest drop site (the `ifup`→first-xmit window:
  carrier / linkwatch / qdisc class) is **not** identified, and
  deliberately not chased — see Deferred.
- **What the instrument overturned — third instance of the same
  failure.** The live classifier labelled the event `ANOMALY A:
  egress hold [kick picked up late → main loop]`. That was wrong,
  and wrong in the shape this log keeps recording:
  - **D-0071:** an unexplained constant kept a plausible-sounding
    name; "host-side remainder" did the work "measured delivery"
    could not.
  - **Threats item 19's own diagnosis:** Δ(E0→E4) ≈ Δ(`W`) with
    first-connect flat read as a delivery signature — one step after
    item 17's lesson was recorded in that file.
  - **This entry:** the sub-label read the **absence** of a TX kick
    as a late kick pickup, and named QEMU's main loop.

  The aggravation is the point. The kick stamp was added
  *specifically* to enforce the boundary rule item 19 demands — and
  its absence was then read as evidence for a hold on the side it
  was built to inspect. The instrument was correct; the label
  inverted its meaning. Three instances, each after the previous
  lesson was written down, is evidence the pattern recurs **under
  vigilance**. That is the argument for instrument rules over care:
  care is what failed each time.

  **Corollary, beside D-0069's, item 17's and item 19's: a
  classifier's fallback branch must be "unattributed", never the
  subsystem the instrument was built to inspect.** Absence of
  evidence in an instrument's own domain is not evidence of a fault
  in that domain. Implemented rather than merely written down: the
  taxonomy now requires **positive** evidence for each side —
  guest-side loss needs one wire ARP plus an empty hole plus sub-ms
  QEMU-internal steps; an egress hold needs ≥ 2 wire ARPs or an
  elevated QEMU-internal step — and anything else classifies as
  `mixed`, which names no subsystem.
- **Correction to threats item 19's supporting evidence.** Item 19's
  sentence "No comparable stall appears in six campaigns (~400
  boots, T4.3 freeze through T4.8)" is **withdrawn as evidence of
  robustness.** It is an absence of *observation* under a detector
  that fires only above slirp's ~1 s cliff and that runs only on
  Linux trials (item 19a), and it records nothing about the quantity
  that governs the race. That quantity is the margin above: ~12.4 ms
  on the current `Image-trimmed`, 0.199 ms on the failing boot. It
  was never measured on any earlier image and cannot be recovered
  from the recorded artifacts — no guest-internal trace was
  captured. The ~400 clean boots are equally consistent with those
  images having had a larger margin, with sub-cliff instances
  passing unremarked, and with luck; the evidence does not
  distinguish them.
- **Excluded from all rate arithmetic:** the earlier interrupted
  4-in-50 run. Its artifacts were overwritten and cannot be
  signature-checked, so those four events cannot be shown to be this
  mechanism. A number that cannot be checked is not evidence; it is
  left out rather than pooled.
- **Pre-registration — fixed before the run, not tunable after.**
  Frozen into `OUTDIR/prereg.txt` with script hashes before boot 1.
  - **Protocol.** N = 5000 boots, current `Image-trimmed`, campaign
    argv, early client, D-0055 controls verified through `bench.py`'s
    own `require_host_controls()` at start **and again at the end**
    (a desktop power-profiles daemon can flip the governor mid-run;
    a run whose controls lapsed is discarded, not reinterpreted).
    ext4 output. Clean boot dirs are dropped after their JSON row is
    recorded; events and near-misses keep full artifacts.
  - **Event (mechanism):** `ftx_wall − announce_wall > 100 ms`.
    Clean is −8.7…+1.0 ms and the retransmit quantum is ~1030 ms, so
    the threshold separates them by an order of magnitude either
    way.
  - **Cliff crossing (campaign-fatal today):** `e0→E4 > 3 s`.
  - **Signature — every event must pass all six:** announce
    ≤ 250 ms guest-mono; exactly one guest ARP request on the wire;
    heal within [0.95, 1.10] s; zero trace events inside the hole;
    kick→write ≤ 1 ms; margin < 8 ms.
  - **Decision rule.** Runnable-as-is iff n ≥ 5000 **and**
    P(198-boot campaign completes | one-sided 95% upper bound on p)
    ≥ 75%. At n = 5000 that reduces exactly to **k ≤ 2**; the tool's
    selftest asserts the equivalence so the criterion and its
    shorthand cannot drift apart.

    | k | 95% upper p | P(campaign completes) |
    |---|---|---|
    | 0 | 0.060% | 88.8% |
    | 1 | 0.095% | 82.8% |
    | 2 | 0.126% | 77.9% |
    | 3 | 0.155% | 73.6% → refused |

  - **One-directional early stop.** Stop once 25 events are seen.
    25 ≥ 3, so it can only fire *after* runnable-as-is is already
    refused; it bounds how long we spend measuring the rate and
    cannot bias the verdict. Report the boots actually run.
  - **Abort policy (decided in advance).** If the bound clears, a
    **single** disclosed abort is acceptable: the attempt count is
    published in the report and the aborted batch ID recorded. One
    attempt is the cap. This is not retry-until-pass — the threshold
    and the cap are both set before the run.
  - **Falsifiers (load-bearing).**
    1. Any event with margin ≥ 8 ms — the ctrl-vq/announce collision
       mechanism is wrong and the margin predictor is not the
       handle. Reopen before implementing the fix.
    2. Any event healing outside [0.95, 1.10] s — not the `neigh`
       retransmit quantum; mechanism wrong.
    3. Any event with ≥ 2 guest ARP requests on the wire — the frame
       *did* reach the ring and QEMU held it. This is an egress hold
       after all, the fix is wrong, and the overturned reading above
       was right.
    4. Any event with a non-empty hole, or a QEMU-internal step
       > 50 ms — a second mechanism is present.
    5. k ≤ 2 at n = 5000, against 1 in 50 in the pilot — the pilot
       and the experiment disagree, the trigger is context-dependent,
       and the bound must not be read as robustness without naming
       what changed. Do not proceed on the bound alone.
  - **Optional, and kept separate from the rate estimate:** ~500
    boots of `Image-stock` (~10 min) to record *its* margin
    distribution. That is the only cheap evidence bearing on whether
    the historical absence was a larger margin. Mechanism evidence
    only — never a rate for the trimmed arm, never a campaign row.
- **The fix, if k ≥ 3 — designed now, so it is not chosen after
  seeing the rate.** In `/init`, between `ifup` and `announce`, set
  the `neigh` parameters for `eth0` by `RTM_SETNEIGHTBL` over
  `AF_NETLINK`: `NDTPA_RETRANS_TIME` = 50 ms (the attribute is
  milliseconds — `nla_get_msecs`) and `NDTPA_MCAST_PROBES` = 20,
  keeping ~1 s of total retry coverage with 20 chances instead of 3.
  Add a `T_NEIGH` stamp so the added cost is measured, not assumed.
  - `# CONFIG_PROC_FS is not set` on this Image, so the `/proc/sys`
    route does not exist; enabling procfs would change the binary
    and make it a different arm, which D-0072 refused.
  - **The wire shape is unchanged in both cases** — one guest ARP
    request on a clean boot, one on an event boot; only the event's
    timing moves from +1030 ms to ~+50 ms. The pcap filters
    (`scripts/pcap_http.py`), the SYN-grid gate and the D-0070
    intervals all see the same frame grid.
  - **Effect on published statistics:** an event trial gains ~+50 ms
    in `W` and E0→E4. At p ≈ 1–2% that is 0–1 trials per 30-trial
    arm; the median of 30 is unmoved and the IQR moves negligibly.
  - **Post-fix acceptance (pre-registered):** zero cliff crossings
    in 5000 boots; every event heals within [40, 120] ms; the
    loss-event rate within 2× of the pre-fix rate. A larger move
    means the intervention perturbed the race itself and the
    pre/post rates are not comparable — disclose rather than claim
    an improvement. Watch for `neigh` FAILED or no first TX: that
    would mean 20 probes over 1 s is insufficient coverage, i.e. the
    drop condition persists longer than the pilot showed.
- **Alternatives considered:** patch or lengthen slirp's
  ARP-pending drop (rejected: it is the only detector that fires
  today; removing it trades a loud abort for a silent ~1 s inflation
  of `W`, which fuses boot and delivery — the exact failure item 19
  exists to prevent). Retry the campaign until a batch completes
  (rejected: at P(complete) ≈ 2%, "eventually it passed" is
  selection on the outcome, and the published medians would come
  from the batch that happened not to trip; the bounded abort policy
  above is the alternative). Static ARP entry (`SIOCSARP`,
  `ATF_PERM`) plus repeated announce probes (rejected as the primary
  fix: simpler and immune to the drop mechanism entirely, but it
  removes the guest ARP exchange from the capture and adds
  DISCARD/ICMP pairs, changing the frame grid the pcap filters and
  the SYN-grid gate read, for no measurement gain over the
  retransmit change — kept as the fallback if falsifier 1 or 2
  fires). Harness-side event classification alone, recording instead
  of aborting (rejected alone, adopted as a component: it keeps a
  campaign completing, but an event trial is still destroyed,
  leaving n = 29 for that arm and forcing either an undisclosed
  n < 30 or appended trials, which is retry by another name). Name
  the exact in-guest drop site with a tracing image (deferred
  below). Do nothing and run T4.8b (rejected: at the pilot rate the
  campaign completes ~2% of the time).
- **Rationale:** the campaign-fatal quantity is not the stall's
  existence but its *duration relative to slirp's cliff*. The cliff
  is load-bearing instrumentation — below it the harness is blind
  (item 19a), so a fix that moves the delay under the cliff while
  leaving it on the wire converts an aborted batch into a recorded
  outlier without buying that silence. Shortening the retransmit
  does exactly that and changes no frame the analysis reads. Fixing
  the guest's drop instead would be the deeper repair, but its site
  is unidentified, and a repair aimed at an unnamed mechanism cannot
  be shown to have worked; the retransmit bound is robust to *why*
  the frame was lost. Measuring first is not diligence for its own
  sake: at p ≈ 1–2% the campaign is unrunnable and at p ≈ 0.1% it is
  fine, and those two worlds are indistinguishable from 100 boots.
- **Consequences:**
  1. Threats item 19 is amended and `report/draft.md`'s item 19 with
     it: the anomaly is renamed from "egress anomaly" to a
     guest-side lost ARP solicit, and the "~400 boots" sentence is
     withdrawn as robustness evidence. No published median, delta or
     exhibit changes — this entry touches no measured number.
  2. Harness: `bench.py` gains passive per-trial signature logging
     on Linux trials (announce→first-TX, wire ARP-request count,
     cliff flag). The interface is the **Bench-host spec (D-0074)**
     section of `results/README.md`. It is a recorded column, never
     a gate that drops a trial.
  3. Artifacts: the `/init` change moves the `init` and
     `rootfs.cpio` hashes in MANIFEST. **Both Image hashes must stay
     put** (`Image-stock fa0f4315…`, `Image-trimmed 1bf91509…`); a
     moved kernel hash means the cpio change triggered a rebuild —
     stop. D-0073's falsifiers 3–5 are unaffected.
  4. T4.8b's Linux arms will run a different `/init` than T4.8's.
     Disclose it: the addition is one netlink round trip before the
     announce, bounded by the `T_NEIGH` stamp, and applied
     identically to stock and trimmed, so the trimmed-vs-stock
     comparison is unaffected. **Correction (2026-08-19, measured):**
     "sub-millisecond" was wrong. `T_NEIGH − T_IFUP` is **2.87 ms**
     (2.826–2.895 ms over six boots), ~1.5 % of the 188 ms
     cross-system delta, inflating the Linux baseline and therefore
     biasing toward Whimbrel. It is measured per trial, so the
     report subtracts a number rather than waving at one — which is
     why the stamp exists (D-0075).
  5. Diagnostic tooling stays outside the repo and uncommitted
     (`~/whimbrel-diag/`): the boot engine, the classifier/rate tool
     and the pre-registered experiment wrapper. The wrapper refuses
     to run until this entry exists in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, which
     makes the house rule mechanical rather than remembered.
  6. New glossary terms: **margin**, **loss event**, **cliff
     crossing** (`docs/GLOSSARY.md`).
- **Deferred this pass (named so they are not found one at a
  time):** naming the exact in-guest drop site (a tracing image with
  qdisc / `neigh` / virtio-net tracepoints, D-0072-style diagnostic
  boots, never a campaign arm) — it does not change the fix, and the
  margin predictor already gives a mechanism-level handle; revisit
  if the signature proves unstable across the 5000 boots, i.e. if
  any of falsifiers 1–4 fires. The same question for the Whimbrel
  arms: Whimbrel ARPs its gateway with its own stack (no `neigh`, no
  qdisc), so this exact mechanism does not transfer, but item 19(a)
  records that its sub-cliff window (~980 ms) is **ungated** and its
  margin has never been measured either — a Whimbrel margin pass is
  cheap and is the honest follow-up to the correction above. Whether
  `Image-stock`'s margin explains the historical absence (the
  optional 500-boot stock pass).
- Revisit trigger: any falsifier firing; a QEMU or host change on
  the bench machine, since margin is a timing quantity and may move;
  or any future `Image` respin, which re-rolls the phase race and
  invalidates the measured rate — the margin distribution must be
  re-measured, not assumed to carry over.
- **Outcome (2026-08-19, experiment complete).** 550 boots, current
  `Image-trimmed` (`1bf91509…`), `prereg.txt` frozen at
  2026-08-19T08:08:11Z against git `2aae7d8` with a clean tree and
  the three script hashes. **k = 25**, p̂ = 4.55 %, 95 % CI
  [2.96 %, 6.64 %], one-sided 95 % upper 6.29 %. P(198-boot campaign
  completes) rounds to 0 % at p̂ *and* at the upper bound, so the
  decision rule refuses **not runnable as-is** without needing the
  full 5000: the one-directional early stop fired at 25 events, and
  it can only fire once runnability is already refused, so it bounds
  how long the rate was measured, never the verdict. k ≥ 3 puts item
  3 into force.
  - **Signature conformance 25/25**, all six tests, and `ftx −
    announce` spans **1028.4–1029.3 ms** — 0.9 ms across 25 events.
    That is one mechanism with one healing deadline, not a family of
    stalls that happen to share a magnitude. Falsifiers 1–5 did not
    fire; the deferred question (naming the in-guest drop site)
    therefore stays deferred, as decided.
- **Correction: the margin is discrete, not continuous.** The bullet
  above reads "not a binary event but a race whose margin is
  measurable on every boot", generalised from 100 boots with a
  single intermediate point at 3.917 ms. At n = 550 the middle is
  **empty**: 25 events at 0.182–0.240 ms, two boots at 8.82 / 8.94
  ms, 523 clean at 12.30–12.73 ms, nothing between (p1 0.192, p10
  12.338, median 12.441 ms; zero near-misses in the pre-registered
  8 ms band). The pilot's 3.917 ms boot does not recur. The two
  intermediate boots moved `ftx − announce` from ≈ −8.4 ms to ≈ −4.6
  ms as well — ARP and announce shifting **together** by ~1 jiffy
  (4 ms at `CONFIG_HZ=250`), which is what a tick-quantised margin
  looks like.
  - The half that survives: margin is observable on every boot, so
    it remains the per-boot risk observable. The half that does not:
    it is a **classifier over a few quantised states**, not a
    regression on a continuum. Reading a trend off three points was
    the D-0069 failure mode again — an estimate that flattered the
    model — and 550 points, not more care, is what corrected it.
  - **This is why the D-0075 fix is sound rather than lucky.** A
    discrete collision window means shortening `RETRANS_TIME`
    changes the *consequence* of a collision and not its
    probability: the ~4.5 % of boots that collide will still
    collide, and must. That converts the post-fix rate check from a
    hoped-for improvement into a **falsifier** — a rate move beyond
    the pre-registered 2× means the intervention perturbed the race
    itself, and pre/post are then not comparable.




## D-0075: Shorten the guest ARP retransmit in `/init`; validate before T4.8b

- Date: 2026-08-19 — Status: accepted (code written and statically
  verified; the validation run is pre-registered below and has not
  been run; T4.8b does not start before its verdict)
- **Decision:**
  1. In `bench/linux/server.c`, between `ifup` and the announce, one
     `RTM_SETNEIGHTBL` over `AF_NETLINK` sets **eth0's** `arp_cache`
     parameters: `NDTPA_RETRANS_TIME` = 50 ms and
     `NDTPA_MCAST_PROBES` = 20. This is D-0074 item 3 made concrete;
     the rate experiment returned k = 25 in 550 boots, which puts
     that item into force.
  2. A `T_NEIGH` stamp brackets the call, so the cost it adds to the
     Linux baseline is **measured per trial**, not argued about.
  3. `bench.py` records two passive per-trial columns on every
     trial of both systems — `guest_ftx_ns` and `guest_arp_req_n` —
     and `bench.py arp-signature` counts events per arm afterwards.
     Recording only; nothing here can fail or drop a trial.
  4. Rebuild the cpio, re-run `just test-linux`, then the
     pre-registered validation run, then T4.8b. In that order.
- **The parameter arithmetic (read out of the 6.18.7 tree we build,
  not from memory).**
  `net/core/neighbour.c:__neigh_event_send()` arms the retransmit at
  `now + max(NEIGH_VAR(parms, RETRANS_TIME), HZ/100)` and probes
  immediately regardless, so **the first solicit's timing is not
  touched by any value chosen here** — only the deadline that heals
  its loss.
  - `arp_tbl.parms` ships `RETRANS_TIME = 1*HZ`. At `CONFIG_HZ=250`
    that is 250 jiffies. `kernel/time/timer.c` puts a delta of 250
    in wheel **level 1** (`LVL_START(1)=63`, `LVL_START(2)=504`),
    granularity 8 jiffies, and `calc_index()` rounds up by one
    bucket so it can never fire early: expiry lands 251–258 jiffies
    out, i.e. **1004–1032 ms**.
  - `msecs_to_jiffies(50)` is `(50 + 4 - 1)/4 = 13` jiffies
    (`MSEC_PER_SEC/HZ = 4`). A delta of 13 is below `LVL_START(1)`,
    so it sits in **level 0** at 1-jiffy granularity, and the same
    round-up makes the expiry exactly **14 jiffies = 56 ms**.
    `max(13, HZ/100 = 2)` keeps the parameter, not the floor, as the
    thing being measured — which is why 50 ms and not 8 ms.
  - Probe budget: `neigh_max_probes()` is
    `UCAST_PROBES + APP_PROBES + MCAST_PROBES` and `neigh->probes`
    starts at `UCAST_PROBES`, so `MCAST_PROBES` is exactly the
    number of solicits before `NUD_FAILED`. Today: 3 at 1 s ≈ 3 s of
    coverage. After: 20 at 52 ms ≈ 1.04 s — the same order of
    coverage, reached 20× sooner. More than ~19 would only convert a
    loud timeout into a slow pass that the cliff detector catches
    anyway, so the budget stops there.
- **`NDTPA_IFINDEX` is mandatory, and its absence would fail
  silently.** `neigh_parms_alloc()` does `kmemdup(&tbl->parms, …)`
  when the netdev registers, so eth0 holds a **private copy** of the
  table defaults. Writing the table default (ifindex 0) sets a
  struct nothing reads, and the kernel still acks 0 — a fix that
  looks applied and is not. `lookup_neigh_parms()` matches
  `p->dev->ifindex`, so the request must name eth0.
- **Placement.** After `ifup` because eth0's IPv4 `arp_parms` follow
  its `in_device`; before the announce because that datagram is what
  forces the solicit. Any placement before the announce shifts the
  announce by the same amount, so the choice is about correctness,
  not about phase.
- **Static verification, before any boot.** The `/init` binary
  cross-compiles with the campaign's own musl toolchain under
  `-Wall -Werror`. The 68-byte message the code emits was decoded
  and asserted field by field against the guest kernel's own uapi
  headers — 13/13: `nlmsg_len` = message length,
  `RTM_SETNEIGHTBL`, `NLM_F_REQUEST|NLM_F_ACK`,
  `ndtm_family = AF_INET`, `NDTA_NAME = "arp_cache\0"`, nested
  `NDTA_PARMS` carrying `NDTPA_IFINDEX` (u32), `NDTPA_RETRANS_TIME`
  (u64, milliseconds — `nla_get_msecs`) and `NDTPA_MCAST_PROBES`
  (u32), every length consuming exactly to `nlmsg_len`. That check
  builds the message with the socket calls stubbed, so it never
  touched the host's own `arp_cache`. At runtime `NLM_F_ACK` plus
  `die_num` turns any rejection into
  `INIT FAIL: RTM_SETNEIGHTBL rejected (-N)` on the serial, which
  every gate already greps: a malformed message cannot pass quietly.
- **What the passive logging can and cannot see — stated rather than
  proxied.**
  - Recorded: `guest_ftx_ns` (guest's first wire TX − slirp's ARP
    request, the same anchor as `W`, so pcap-internal per D-0071)
    and `guest_arp_req_n`.
  - **Margin is not recordable in a campaign.** It is defined
    against the last virtio ctrl-vq completion, which only a QEMU
    `virtqueue_pop` trace exposes, and enabling that trace would
    change the measured configuration. So the campaign records the
    **consequence** and margin stays a bench-diagnostic quantity.
    Naming the limit instead of substituting a proxy is the item-19
    discipline.
  - **`guest_arp_req_n` is blind to the event this entry is about,
    and that blindness is its designed scope.** It can see exactly
    one condition: a loss window that outlives one retransmit, which
    puts a **second** request on the wire. The D-0074 event puts
    **one** request there — the solicit is lost before it reaches
    the ring, so the retransmit is the only frame that ever exists
    — and a clean boot also shows one, before and after this
    change. It follows that `guest_arp_req_n = 1` across a whole
    campaign is **not evidence that no events occurred**: that
    column reads the same at 0 events and at all of them. Treating
    a clean value as absence would be threats item 19 in miniature
    — a conclusion drawn from an instrument that does not span the
    thing being concluded about. The detection path is
    `guest_ftx_ns` against the arm's own median; `guest_arp_req_n`
    bounds the loss window's **length** and nothing else, which is
    why it appears again as falsifier 4 below.
  - Detection is therefore per-arm and after the fact:
    `bench.py arp-signature` flags trials whose `guest_ftx_ns`
    exceeds their **own arm's** median by > 20 ms. A fixed threshold
    cannot work — `guest_ftx_ns` contains the whole guest boot,
    which differs per arm. 20 ms sits an order of magnitude above
    the within-arm clean spread (~1 ms) and well under the smallest
    event this change can produce (~52 ms).
- **Effect on the published baseline, disclosed in the direction
  that matters.** The netlink round trip is on the measured path and
  inflates **every** Linux trial, which biases the cross-system
  comparison **in Whimbrel's favour**. `T_NEIGH − T_IFUP` bounds it
  per trial; it is applied identically to stock and trimmed, so
  trimmed-vs-stock is unaffected. The first measurement of it comes
  out of the validation run, and the report quotes that number
  rather than "sub-millisecond".
- **Deliberately not changed.** `report-exhibits.py`'s
  `INIT_STAMP_ORDER` keeps its seven names: it is a
  required-presence list applied to **pinned git objects** whose
  serials predate `neigh`, so adding the name there would break
  T4.6 / T4.8 exhibit regeneration. The new stamp is recorded by the
  harness, never by the pinned decomposition. Both `Image` hashes
  stay put (D-0074 consequence 3). The wire shape stays as D-0074
  described it.
- **Pre-registration — validation run, fixed before it starts.**
  5000 boots on the new cpio via `~/whimbrel-diag/stall-validate.sh`,
  same D-0055 host controls, same event and cliff definitions,
  script hashes frozen into `prereg.txt` before boot 1. It is a
  **sibling** of `stall-rate.sh`, not an edit to it: that script is
  the frozen D-0074 instrument and its pre-registration hardcodes
  the pre-fix heal band [0.95, 1.10] s, under which every post-fix
  event would read as nonconforming. A different pre-registration
  gets a different script and a different frozen `prereg.txt`. The
  new wrapper additionally refuses to run against the pre-fix
  `init` hash or an `init` with no `RTM_SETNEIGHTBL` string, and
  records `git diff HEAD` plus its sha256 so a run made against an
  uncommitted tree stays reproducible. No early stop: events are
  expected, so the run measures all 5000.
  - **Binding acceptance is D-0074's and is not restated more
    loosely here:** zero cliff crossings; every event heals within
    **[40, 120] ms**; loss-event rate within **2×** of 4.55 %.
  - **Sharper expectations declared now** (a stricter prediction
    added before the run is legitimate; a looser one after it is
    not). Predicted heal: the deadline moves from 258 to 14 jiffies,
    a shift of 976 ms, so `ftx − announce` should land at
    **52.4–53.3 ms** against the observed 1028.4–1029.3 ms. The
    ~5–8 ms the wheel model does not account for (one tick of
    `neigh_timer_handler` plus the pcap write) is common to both
    configurations, which is why the **shift** is predicted more
    confidently than the absolute. Also expected: `guest_arp_req_n`
    = 1 on every boot; and the margin distribution unchanged in
    **shape** — three tight clusters with empty gaps — but **not**
    in location, for the reason measured below.
- **Measured before the run, on the rebuilt cpio (40 clean boots
  plus 6 with stamps kept; `just test-linux` green).**
  - **The netlink round trip costs 2.87 ms** (`T_NEIGH − T_IFUP`,
    2.826–2.895 ms, n = 6) — not the sub-millisecond D-0074
    assumed. Corrected there. Under TCG a socket, an ioctl, a
    `sendto`, an ack `recv` and a `close` through `rtnl_lock` is
    simply not free, and guessing was the wrong move; the stamp is.
  - **The margin's location moves by exactly that cost**: clean
    median 12.44 ms before, **15.29 ms** after, a shift of 2.85 ms
    against a measured 2.87 ms. That is mechanical, not
    coincidental — the netlink call delays the announce and does
    not touch the virtio ctrl-vq completions the margin is measured
    from. `ready − e0` (280 → 283 ms) and E0→E4 (282 → 285.5 ms)
    move by the same amount, which is the cross-check.
  - **This is a known perturbation of the race's phase, declared
    before the run rather than discovered after it.** The margin is
    tick-quantised (D-0074 Outcome), so moving the announce 2.87 ms
    later moves it ~0.7 jiffies away from the collision point. The
    rate may therefore move for a reason that has nothing to do
    with `RETRANS_TIME`. Falsifier 3 already covers it; what
    changes is that a rate move is now **expected as a live
    possibility**, not a surprise, and it must not be reported as
    the fix working.
  - 0 events in 40 pre-flight boots is consistent with 4.5 %
    (P = 15.7 %) and is not evidence of anything.
- **The k = 0 branch, decided in advance.** If the 5000-boot run
  finds no events at all, the shortened retransmit is **untested**:
  no event means no heal to time, so the [40, 120] ms criterion
  cannot pass — it can only fail to apply. The report must then say
  the heal path is untested and that the observed change is
  consistent with the 2.87 ms phase shift having moved the race off
  its collision point, which is not a result anyone designed for.
  What still holds: the wire shape, the detector, and the permanent
  signature logging that makes a later event countable.
  - **Falsifiers.**
    1. Any cliff crossing → the change did not work. Stop; T4.8b
       does not run.
    2. Any event outside [40, 120] ms → mechanism or arithmetic
       wrong; re-open the diagnosis.
    3. Rate outside [2.3 %, 9.1 %] → the intervention perturbed the
       race rather than its consequence. Disclose; pre- and post-fix
       rates are then not comparable and no improvement is claimed.
    4. Any boot with ≥ 2 guest ARP requests → the loss window
       outlives one retransmit; the one-shot model is wrong and the
       probe budget must be re-derived.
    5. More than 1 % of boots with margin in 0.3–8 ms → the discrete
       collision window recorded in D-0074's Outcome is wrong.
    6. Any `INIT FAIL: RTM_SETNEIGHTBL …` → the netlink path is not
       robust on this kernel. Stop.
  - **A heal well under 1 s but outside [40, 70] ms** falsifies the
    wheel arithmetic while leaving the mechanism intact. That is a
    weaker and separately recorded outcome, not a reason to re-open
    the diagnosis — it is written down here so the two cannot be
    conflated afterwards.
  - Abort policy is unchanged from D-0074: one attempt, disclosed as
    an attempt count with the aborted batch ID recorded.
- **Alternatives considered.**
  - **Pre-seed the neighbour entry** (`RTM_NEWNEIGH`,
    `NUD_PERMANENT`, gateway MAC `52:55:0a:00:02:02`). Removes the
    race outright instead of shortening it, and D-0062 already
    allows a warm cache. Rejected twice over: it deletes ARP
    resolution from the Linux baseline while Whimbrel still pays for
    it — a bias toward Linux, larger than the one this change
    introduces — and it hardcodes libslirp's derived MAC into the
    baseline, the clever-over-legible trade this project refuses.
  - **Emit a raw ARP from `AF_PACKET`.** Same objection, plus
    `/init` would stop exercising the ordinary send path, so the
    baseline would no longer be what an ordinary Linux service does.
  - **Enable `CONFIG_PROC_FS` and write the sysctl.** Refused in
    D-0074: it changes the Image and makes it a different arm, which
    D-0072 already refused for the same reason.
  - **Patch or lengthen slirp's ARP-pending drop** — D-0074 item 6;
    it is the detector.
  - **Retry failed batches** — D-0074 item 7.
  - **200 ms instead of 50 ms.** Still 5× under the cliff and still
    wheel level 0, so no mechanical advantage, and it leaves less
    headroom if the loss window is longer than 550 boots showed.
  - **8 ms instead of 50 ms.** The `max(…, HZ/100)` floor takes
    over and the constant stops meaning what it says.
- **Rationale.** The campaign-fatal quantity was never the stall's
  existence but its **length**: ~1.03 s is just past slirp's
  ARP-pending drop, and the drop is what snaps the queued SYN onto a
  ~6 s RTO. Moving the heal two decades earlier leaves the race, the
  wire shape and the detector exactly where they were, and converts
  a destroyed trial into a ~+52 ms outlier that is published rather
  than lost. Every constant here is read out of the kernel we
  actually build, so the prediction is falsifiable before the run
  rather than fitted after it.
- **Consequences.**
  1. MANIFEST `init` and `rootfs.cpio` hashes move; both `Image`
     hashes must not. A moved Image hash means the cpio change
     triggered a kernel rebuild — stop.
  2. `runs.csv` gains `guest_ftx_ns` and `guest_arp_req_n`.
     Historical objects lack both; `arp-signature` **refuses** such
     a CSV rather than reporting a clean run off a column that was
     never recorded.
  3. The shared synthetic pcap fixture gains a guest ARP request, so
     `d0070-pcap-pass.py` and `bench.py selftest` expectations move
     together. Both selftests pass; `bench.py selftest` additionally
     plants a +52 ms event and asserts the classifier finds it and
     ignores ordinary jitter.
  4. T4.8b's Linux arms run a different `/init` than T4.8's, with
     the cost bounded by `T_NEIGH` (D-0074 consequence 4).
  5. New glossary terms land with D-0074's: **margin**, **loss
     event**, **cliff crossing**.
- **Scope correction (2026-08-19, after T4.8b's per-trial logging
  went live): the ≥ 2-ARP falsifier and the `guest_arp_req_n` ≥ 2
  reading apply to Linux boots only — on Whimbrel arms they are
  inapplicable, not merely unlikely to fire.** Whimbrel's D-0046
  wire shape is two ARP requests by construction: the gateway
  solicit, then a gratuitous ARP (`arp.isgratuitous`, sender =
  target = 10.0.2.15) ~1–7 ms later. Every Whimbrel trial therefore
  records `guest_arp_req_n = 2` in a clean boot, and "a second
  request means the loss window outlived one retransmit" is a
  statement about Linux `/init`'s single forced solicit that has no
  Whimbrel reading at all. The falsifier as pre-registered was
  applied only to Linux boots (D-0074/D-0075/D-0076 runs), so no
  conclusion is affected; what was wrong was the unscoped wording
  here and in `results/README.md`, both now scoped.
- **Loose end, recorded not fixed:** `scripts/linux-boot-test.sh`
  removes its `mktemp -d` workdir in an `EXIT` trap, so a failing
  boot destroys its own serial and pcap. Two consecutive failures of
  that gate were observed on 2026-08-19 with the output discarded
  and could not be attributed; 40 subsequent runs passed. Keeping
  the workdir on failure is the obvious repair and is exactly what
  D-0074 item 4 asks for one level up — countable, not merely fatal.
- **Outcome (2026-08-19, validation run complete).** 5000 boots on
  the post-fix cpio (`rootfs.cpio 258c9325…`, `init b6cb40b4…`;
  both `Image` hashes unmoved), D-0055 controls verified before and
  after. **k = 0.** All six falsifiers pass; the campaign is
  statistically runnable. **The shortened retransmit is untested** —
  the k = 0 branch above applies verbatim: no event means no heal to
  time, so the [40, 120] ms criterion could only fail to apply. "The
  events stopped" and "the mechanism is fixed" are different claims
  and only the first is supported. D-0076 builds the diagnostic that
  tries to make the second one testable.
- **Correction: the margin distribution changed shape, not only
  location — and falsifier 5 was too narrow to catch it.** The
  expectation declared above was "unchanged in shape, not in
  location". Location moved as predicted (median 12.44 → 15.20 ms,
  +2.76 against a measured 2.87 ms cost). Shape did not survive:

  | mode (ms) | pre-fix, n=550 | post-fix, n=5000 |
  |---|---|---|
  | main | 12.44 (95.1 %) | 15.20 (95.3 %) |
  | main − 1.7 | — | 13.5 (2.6 %) |
  | main − 3.7 | 8.8 (0.4 %) | 11.5 (0.9 %) |
  | main − 8.7 | — | 6.5 (0.18 %) |
  | main + 4.3 | — | 19.5 (0.4 %) |
  | main − 12.24 | **0.2 (4.5 %, every event)** | **absent** |

  Falsifier 5 tested a fixed absolute window (0.3–8 ms) and passed
  on 0.18 %. A shape test would have failed. Writing an absolute
  window for a quantity whose location was expected to move was the
  error, and it is the same error in miniature as the rest of this
  log: the instrument did not span the thing being concluded about.
- **What the vanished mode implies, and it is not what D-0075
  assumed.** If margin were an independent input, the `main − 12.24`
  mode should still occur at ~4.5 % post-fix and simply land at
  2.96 ms instead of 0.2 ms. It does not occur at all — 9 boots in
  the whole 0.3–8 ms window, none near 3 ms. So that mode does not
  exist apart from the event: **the ~0.2 ms margin is co-occurrent
  with the loss, not an independent cause of it.** The margin is a
  marker, not a knob, which is a further demotion of the "predictor"
  reading D-0074's Outcome already corrected once.
- **A second candidate explanation, not yet separated.** The netlink
  round trip is not only 2.87 ms of delay: `RTM_SETNEIGHTBL` takes
  `rtnl_lock`, so it is also a **synchronisation barrier** against
  the netdev machinery that is the prime suspect for eating the
  solicit. "The announce moved 2.87 ms later" and "the announce now
  happens after an rtnl barrier" both explain k = 0, and this run
  cannot tell them apart. D-0076 is designed to.
- Revisit trigger: any falsifier above; a QEMU, kernel or host
  change on the bench machine, since every constant here is derived
  from `CONFIG_HZ`, the timer-wheel geometry and `arp_tbl`'s
  defaults; or a Buildroot/kernel bump, which must re-derive the
  jiffy arithmetic rather than inherit it.

## D-0076: A diagnostic image that restores the collision, to test the heal path

- Date: 2026-08-19 — Status: accepted, **with its mechanism
  conclusion retracted by Arm N** (four arms run; the heal path is
  still unexercised; see Arm N outcome, which supersedes the Arm S
  reading and strikes the collision-window bound).
  Diagnostic only: **never a campaign arm, never a published row,
  never in `bench/linux/artifacts/` or MANIFEST.**
- **Why.** D-0075's validation returned k = 0 in 5000 boots. The
  campaign is runnable, but the shortened retransmit never fired, so
  the heal is untested. T4.8b should not run on "the events stopped"
  when the claim we need is "a lost solicit heals at ~52 ms".
- **Decision:**
  1. Build a variant `/init` **outside the repo**
     (`~/whimbrel-diag/margin-probe/`), from the committed
     `bench/linux/server.c` plus one mechanical patch, into its own
     cpio. `bench/linux/artifacts/` and MANIFEST stay pinned at
     `rootfs.cpio 258c9325…` / `init b6cb40b4…`, and the boot engine
     gains a `CPIO_OVERRIDE` env so nothing in the repo moves.
  2. **Arm C (`early`) — the primary.** Move the netlink call from
     between `ifup` and the announce to **before `ifup`**. The
     announce returns to its pre-fix instant and the margin to
     ~12.44 ms, with the shortened retransmit still active.
  3. **Arm A (`early+pad`) — the discriminator**, built now and run
     only if Arm C's result needs it. Same reorder plus a
     spin-only 2.87 ms delay before the announce, restoring the
     *validated* image's announce instant.
  4. Report to a fresh output dir with its own frozen
     pre-registration. `stall-rate.sh` and `stall-validate.sh` are
     not touched.
- **Correction to the proposed design: a compensating delay moves
  the margin the wrong way.** `margin = announce − last ctrl-vq
  pop`, and the ctrl-vq completions are caused by `ifup` itself
  (the D-0074 timeline puts them at +0.262–0.269 s, at `ifup`, not
  at the +0.217 s probe kicks). The post-fix stamps confirm it:
  `ifup` 153.8 ms, `neigh` 156.7, `announce` 168.9 — `announce −
  ifup` = 15.1 ms against a measured margin of 15.29. **The margin
  is essentially the `ifup`→`announce` interval.** Adding a delay
  before the announce therefore *increases* it, moving further from
  the collision, not back to it. Restoring ~12.44 ms requires
  **removing** the 2.87 ms from that interval, which a reorder does
  and a delay cannot.
  - Moving the call before `ifup` is legal:
    `net/ipv4/devinet.c:inetdev_event()` calls `inetdev_init()` at
    **`NETDEV_REGISTER`**, so `in_dev->arp_parms` exists from
    virtio-net probe, long before the interface has an address.
    `SIOCGIFINDEX` likewise needs only registration. The earlier
    "after `ifup`, because eth0's arp_parms follow its `in_device`"
    (D-0075) was the right instinct and the wrong trigger.
  - A reorder is also **stricter** than the requested delay against
    the second constraint: the netlink write is byte-identical and
    the announce is untouched, and nothing new executes at all.
- **What Arm A separates, and why it is worth building now.** The
  netlink call is not only 2.87 ms of delay: `RTM_SETNEIGHTBL` takes
  `rtnl_lock`, so it is also a barrier against the netdev machinery
  that is the prime suspect for eating the solicit. Three positions,
  two variables:

  | arm | barrier | announce instant | events? |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | validated (D-0075) | late | late | 0 / 5000 |
  | C `early` | early | early (pre-fix) | ? |
  | A `early+pad` | early | late | ? |

  Events in C only → the announce instant is what matters. Events in
  both → the barrier's **position** matters, not the timing. Events
  in neither → neither, and the margin story is wrong.
- **The pad is a spin, not a sleep.** `nanosleep` would idle the
  hart and let softirqs and workqueues run, which is itself a change
  to the race; the 2.87 ms it replaces is spent CPU-busy inside a
  syscall. A `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` spin is the closer
  analogue and touches no network state.
- **Pre-registration — fixed before the run.**
  - **Protocol.** Arm C, N = 600 boots, `Image-trimmed` unchanged,
    diagnostic cpio, campaign argv and pins, D-0055 host controls
    checked before and after, script and cpio hashes frozen into
    `prereg.txt` before boot 1. No early stop.
  - **Predicted heal, three bands, and which one binds.** Binding is
    D-0074's **[40, 120] ms**, unchanged. Declared point prediction:
    **[52.4, 53.3] ms** — the pre-fix events healed at
    1028.4–1029.3 ms and the armed deadline moves 258 → 14 jiffies,
    i.e. 976 ms at `CONFIG_HZ=250`. The naive first-principles value
    is ~47.5 ms (14 jiffies = 56 ms, less the 8.46 ms by which the
    clean solicit precedes the announce stamp); the ~5 ms gap is the
    unmodelled `neigh_timer_handler` + pcap-write residual D-0075
    already named, and it is the reason the **shift** is predicted
    rather than the absolute. A heal inside [40, 70] ms but outside
    [52.4, 53.3] falsifies the arithmetic, not the mechanism, and is
    recorded separately.
  - **Predicted rate:** near the pre-fix 4.5455 % (25/550). Band
    **[2.27 %, 9.09 %]** (2× either way). At N = 600 and p = 4.5 %
    that is ~27 events, enough to bound the heal band tightly.
  - **Predicted margin:** median back to 12.44 ± 0.3 ms, and the
    event cluster back at ~0.2 ms.
  - **Falsifiers.**
    1. Any heal outside [40, 120] ms → the retransmit or the timer
       arithmetic is wrong. Stop.
    2. Any cliff crossing → the shortened retransmit does not heal
       below slirp's drop, i.e. D-0075's fix does not work. Stop;
       T4.8b does not run.
    3. Any boot with ≥ 2 guest ARP requests → the loss window
       outlives one retransmit; the probe budget must be re-derived.
    4. Rate outside [2.27 %, 9.09 %] → restoring the announce
       instant did not restore the collision probability, so the
       2.87 ms phase shift was not the whole story.
    5. Margin median not back within 0.3 ms of 12.44 → the reorder
       did not do what it was built to do; the run says nothing
       about the heal either way.
  - **The k = 0 branch, again and in advance.** If Arm C produces no
    events, say exactly that: position alone does not restore the
    collision, the margin is not the mechanism, and **the heal path
    remains untested**. That is not a claim that the fix works, and
    it is not a reason to run T4.8b on the strength of D-0075's
    k = 0. The next step would be Arm A, and after that a forced
    drop, which tests the retransmit at the cost of no longer
    testing the original loss site.
- **Alternatives considered.**
  - **A compensating delay, as proposed.** Directionally wrong; see
    the correction above. Kept as Arm A's pad, where its purpose is
    to *restore* the validated instant, not to reduce the margin.
  - **Force a drop instead of restoring the race** (a tiny
    `txqueuelen`, or a zero `QUEUE_LEN_BYTES`). Would give a 100 %
    event rate and a clean test of the retransmit and the timer —
    but at a different drop site, so it would verify the heal while
    no longer verifying the mechanism D-0074 named. Held in reserve
    for the k = 0 branch, where a partial answer beats none.
  - **Revert to the pre-fix `/init` and re-measure.** Restores the
    race exactly, but with the 1 s retransmit, so it tests nothing
    about the fix.
  - **Ship the reorder to production.** Deliberately deferred until
    this run says what it does. If Arm C restores a 4.5 % event rate
    that heals at ~52 ms, then the reorder is arguably the *better*
    production placement — it validates on the real mechanism
    instead of accidentally suppressing it — and that is a decision
    to take on evidence, in its own entry, not as a side effect.
- **Rationale.** k = 0 is a good campaign outcome and a bad
  scientific one. The cheapest way to earn the second claim is to
  put the announce back where the collision lives while keeping the
  shortened deadline, and the cheapest way to do *that* turns out to
  be moving code rather than adding it.
- **Consequences.**
  1. `~/whimbrel-diag/stall-repro.sh` gains `CPIO_OVERRIDE`; with it
     set, the run records the override's sha256 and still hashes the
     MANIFEST artifacts for batch-start IO fidelity.
  2. A third pre-registration and a third wrapper. `stall-rate.sh`
     (D-0074) and `stall-validate.sh` (D-0075) stay frozen: each
     pre-registration owns its script.
  3. The diagnostic cpio is never hashed into MANIFEST and never
     boots a campaign trial. Its own gate refuses to run if the
     repo's `init` hash has moved.
- **Outcome (2026-08-19, both arms run).** Arm C (`early`) and Arm A
  (`early+pad`), 600 boots each, D-0055 controls verified before and
  after, campaign artifacts confirmed untouched. **k = 0 in both.**
  With D-0075's validation that is **0 events in 6200 boots across
  three configurations**, against 25/550 = 4.5455 % pre-fix.

  | config | netlink | `rtnl_lock` at | announce (guest-mono) | margin | k |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | pre-fix, n=550 | absent | — | 165.4 ms | 12.44 ms | **25 (4.55 %)** |
  | validated, n=5000 | present | ~156 ms (post-`ifup`) | 168.2 ms | 15.20 ms | 0 |
  | Arm C, n=600 | present | ~148 ms (pre-`ifup`) | 168.1 ms | 12.35 ms | 0 |
  | Arm A, n=600 | present | ~148 ms (pre-`ifup`) | 170.9 ms | 15.13 ms | 0 |

  - **Margin is ruled out.** Arm C restored it to 12.348 ms — 0.09 ms
    from the pre-fix median, inside falsifier 5's tolerance — and
    nothing fired. Across the three post-fix arms margin took
    12.35 / 15.13 / 15.20 ms, spanning the pre-fix value, with k = 0
    throughout. The margin is not the coordinate the race lives in.
    D-0074's Outcome demoted it from predictor to classifier; this
    demotes it again, to a marker with no causal content.
  - **Barrier *position* is ruled out.** `rtnl_lock` was taken after
    `ifup` in the validated image and ~8 ms before it in both probe
    arms. No difference. In particular the natural form of the
    serialisation story — that the call waits out `ifup`'s deferred
    linkwatch work — is **refuted**: in Arms C and A the lock is
    released before `ifup` is even called.
- **What this establishes, and what it does not.** Two candidates
  remain, and they are **perfectly confounded** by every arm run so
  far:
  1. **The call's presence** — `RTM_SETNEIGHTBL` takes `rtnl_lock`
     (`net/core/neighbour.c:3922` registers it without
     `RTNL_FLAG_DOIT_UNLOCKED`, so `rtnl_lock()` is taken at
     `net/core/rtnetlink.c:6957`), serialising against the netdev
     machinery that is the prime suspect for eating the solicit.
     This is the leading reading and is mechanically grounded.
  2. **The absolute announce instant.** Every post-fix arm announces
     at **168.1–170.9 ms**; pre-fix announces at **165.4 ms**. No arm
     restored the pre-fix absolute instant, because the call costs
     2.7–5.5 ms and nothing was removed to pay for it. If the
     collision partner is anchored to boot time rather than to
     `ifup`, "the announce now happens ≥ 2.7 ms later" explains k = 0
     on its own, with no serialisation involved.

  Arm C is what forces this caveat: it holds the margin at the
  pre-fix value while the absolute announce stays late, so it
  separates margin from absolute time but not presence from absolute
  time. **Recording (1) as established would be the fourth instance
  of this log's recurring failure** — attributing to a subsystem
  across a boundary no instrument spans (D-0071, threats item 19,
  D-0074's classifier overturn). It is recorded as the leading
  hypothesis, not as the finding.
  - **The experiment that would separate them** is one arm and ~5
    minutes: **no netlink call at all** (pre-fix `neigh` parameters)
    plus a spin sized to put the announce at ~168.2 ms. Events back
    at ~4.5 % → the call's presence is the cause. k = 0 → the
    absolute announce instant is, and the serialisation reading is
    wrong. It tests the *mechanism*, not the deployed fix, which is
    why it is named rather than run by default.
- **What remains untested, stated plainly.** The shortened
  retransmit **never fired in 6200 boots**. Therefore:
  - the wheel arithmetic (250 → 13 jiffies armed, level 1 → level 0,
    fires at 14 jiffies) is **unverified** — it is read correctly out
    of the 6.18.7 source and has never been observed;
  - the declared heal band [52.4, 53.3] ms and the binding [40, 120]
    ms are **unexercised**; falsifier 1 reads FAIL in both probe
    reports for exactly that reason (`0 outside, 0 timed`), which is
    "could not apply", not "failed";
  - `MCAST_PROBES = 20` is likewise unexercised.
  The deployed change is justified by source reading and by the
  absence of events, not by an observed heal. T4.8b runs on that
  basis, and the report says so.
- **The forced drop is declined, not deferred.** Shrinking
  `txqueuelen` (or zeroing `QUEUE_LEN_BYTES`) would drop a frame at
  the qdisc and let the `neigh` retransmit heal it, which would
  verify the timer arithmetic at a 100 % event rate. It would not
  touch the fix that is actually deployed: the loss D-0074 named
  happens somewhere in the `ifup`→first-xmit path, and a qdisc drop
  is a different site with a different trigger. The retransmit that
  heals it is the same code, so the run would produce a real number
  and an unreal claim — the appearance of completeness bought by
  testing the wrong thing. An unexercised path recorded as
  unexercised is worth more than a green result about a mechanism we
  did not deploy.
- **Arm S — the discriminating arm, pre-registered 2026-08-19 after
  the outcome above and before it was run.** The two survivors are
  confounded because no arm removed the call while holding the
  announce late. Arm S does exactly that: **no netlink call at all**
  (eth0 keeps the stock `RETRANS_TIME` 1 s / `MCAST_PROBES` 3), with
  a `clock_gettime` spin of the same duration at the same call site,
  so the announce stays at the validated instant. Single variable:
  presence.
  - **It tests the mechanism, not the deployed fix.** It reverts the
    fix on purpose, so nothing it finds changes whether T4.8b runs —
    only what D-0076 concludes about *why* the events stopped.
  - **Protocol.** N = 600, `Image-trimmed` unchanged, diagnostic cpio
    outside the repo, campaign argv and pins, D-0055 controls before
    and after, `SPIN_NS` frozen into `prereg.txt` before boot 1.
  - **Arm validity — checked first, because a mis-sized arm makes
    either k meaningless.** Spin cost (`T_NEIGH − T_IFUP`) median
    **2.87 ± 0.10 ms**, the cost it replaces; announce median
    **168.2 ± 1.0 ms** (validated image 168.22, Arm C 168.10,
    pre-fix 165.43). Calibrated on 8 smoke boots at
    `SPIN_NS = 2 870 000`: spin 2.875–2.878 ms, `ifup`→announce
    15.13–15.35 ms against the validated 15.1.
  - **Outcomes, fixed in advance.**
    - **k inside [2.27 %, 9.09 %] → PRESENCE.** The absolute
      announce instant does not explain the suppression; the call
      does, and the `rtnl_lock` serialisation reading survives as
      the leading mechanism.
    - **k = 0 → INSTANT.** The serialisation reading is **wrong**.
      The deployed fix works by accident of its **cost**, not its
      function — which matters because anything that later makes
      that call cheaper (a faster host, a leaner `rtnl` path, a
      kernel bump) would silently re-arm the race. That is the more
      interesting result and the one with a standing consequence.
    - **0 < k outside the band → AMBIGUOUS.** Partial restoration;
      claim neither mechanism outright.
  - **The cliff inversion is deliberate.** This arm runs the stock
    1 s retransmit, so an event heals at ~1.03 s and crosses slirp's
    drop. Cliff crossings are the **expected positive result here**,
    not a falsifier — the opposite of their role in D-0075 and in
    Arms C and A. Events are also the confirmation that it is the
    same mechanism: each must pass the D-0074 signature on the
    **pre-fix** band [0.95, 1.10] s.
  - **Checks that stay falsifiers:** any boot with ≥ 2 guest ARP
    requests; any event failing that signature.
- **Arm S outcome (2026-08-19). Verdict: INSTANT. The serialisation
  reading is refuted.** 600 boots, arm validity passed first — spin
  cost 2.876 ms against the 2.87 ms it replaces, announce median
  168.61 ms against the 168.2 ± 1.0 ms target. **k = 0**, with no
  netlink call, no `rtnl_lock`, and stock `neigh` parameters.

  | config | netlink | announce p10 / median / p90 | k |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | pre-fix, n=550 | **absent** | 165.02 / **165.43** / 166.32 | **25 (4.55 %)** |
  | Arm S, n=600 | **absent** | 168.23 / **168.61** / 173.55 | 0 |
  | Arm C, n=600 | present (pre-`ifup`) | 167.55 / 168.10 / 172.71 | 0 |
  | validated, n=5000 | present (post-`ifup`) | 167.83 / 168.22 / 172.86 | 0 |
  | Arm A, n=600 | present + pad | 170.54 / 170.87 / 175.49 | 0 |

  Netlink presence varies across the table and does not track k;
  it is absent in the one config that collides *and* in one that
  does not. The announce instant tracks k perfectly. **The fix works
  by accident of its cost, not by its function.**
  - **The 2.87 ms is load-bearing, not merely a disclosed liability.**
    Everywhere else in this log that cost is written up as a bias to
    subtract. It is also the entire protection: make the pre-announce
    path cheaper — a faster host, a leaner `rtnl` path, a kernel or
    Buildroot bump, or "optimising away" the netlink round trip — and
    the race re-arms silently. Any future rung that touches `/init`'s
    pre-announce path must re-measure the rate, not inherit it.
  - **A bound on the collision window falls out.** The race is armed
    at an announce of ≤ 166.32 ms (pre-fix p90) and disarmed at
    ≥ 167.55 ms (Arm C p10), so whatever the announce collides with
    finishes in **(166.3, 167.6) ms** guest-mono — a ~1.3 ms window.
    That is the first positive constraint on the drop site D-0074
    deferred naming, and it came free.
  - **What Arm S does not close: a time-of-day confound.** The
    pre-fix run was measured at 04:08 and every other config between
    11:17 and 13:20. Its announce distribution is also much tighter
    (p10–p90 1.30 ms) than every later run's (5.0–5.2 ms), which is
    evidence that *something* about the host differed beyond `/init`.
    The controlled comparison is Arm S versus pre-fix — identical
    sources apart from the 2.87 ms spin — but they are nine hours
    apart, so "the instant" and "the host at 04:08" are not yet
    separated. **Arm N (null)** closes it: the current source with
    the netlink call removed and *no* spin, run now. Announce back at
    ~165.4 ms with k ≈ 4.5 % confirms the instant and excludes the
    host; announce at ~168 ms with k = 0 would mean neither `/init`
    change explains anything and the suppression is environmental.
    ~5 minutes; not run, because it is a new pre-registration.
- **Arm N — the null control, pre-registered 2026-08-19 after Arm S
  and before it was run.** The pre-fix `/init` rebuilt and run *now*:
  netlink call removed, **nothing** put in its place, stock `neigh`
  parameters. It is the one comparison Arm S could not make, because
  Arm S's counterpart — the colliding 25/550 run — was recorded nine
  hours earlier.
  - **Why it is worth five minutes.** The confound is the kind that
    **retracts** rather than qualifies. Every config that fails to
    collide was recorded between 11:17 and 13:20; the one that
    collides was recorded at 04:08, and its announce distribution is
    visibly tighter (p10–p90 **1.30 ms** against 5.0–5.2 ms
    everywhere since). That is positive evidence something about the
    host differed, not merely an absence of control.
  - **Second time today an early-morning run has anchored a
    conclusion.** The D-0074 pilot's 1-in-50 came from the same
    session. If Arm N indicts the host, **both** rate estimates —
    the pilot's 1/50 and the pre-registered 25/550 — re-read as
    measurements of a host state rather than of the image, and
    D-0074's rate arithmetic goes with them.
  - **Protocol.** N = 600, `Image-trimmed` unchanged, diagnostic cpio
    outside the repo, campaign argv and pins, D-0055 controls before
    and after, hashes frozen before boot 1.
  - **Arm validity.** `T_NEIGH − T_IFUP` ≤ 0.05 ms (nothing replaced
    the call); no boot with ≥ 2 guest ARP requests; every event
    conforms to the D-0074 signature on the **pre-fix** band
    [0.95, 1.10] s. Cliff crossings are expected if k > 0.
  - **Branches, both fixed in advance and leading opposite ways.**
    - **Announce 165.43 ± 1.0 ms *and* k in [2.27 %, 9.09 %] →
      INSTANT CONFIRMED.** The host is excluded, the 2.87 ms of
      pre-announce work is causal, and D-0076's conclusion — with
      its standing warning that the cost is the protection — stands.
    - **Announce not back to 165.43 ± 1.0 ms → ENVIRONMENTAL.** The
      boot timeline moved for reasons `/init` does not control.
      **D-0076's conclusion retracts**: neither the call nor its
      cost is shown to suppress anything, and the two rate estimates
      above must be re-read.
    - **Announce back but k outside the band → SPLIT.** The instant
      is restored and the collision is not, so neither `/init`
      timing nor the call explains the suppression and something
      else changed since 04:08. **D-0076 retracts** on the same
      terms.
  - **What it does not decide.** Whether T4.8b runs. The campaign is
    safe on 0/5000 in the deployed image either way; Arm N settles
    only what the report may *say* about why.
- **Arm N outcome (2026-08-19). Pre-registered verdict: SPLIT.
  D-0076's mechanism conclusion retracts.** 600 boots, validity
  passed (`T_NEIGH − T_IFUP` = 0.0031 ms, no ≥ 2-ARP boot, 0
  nonconforming events). The announce returned to **165.64 ms**
  (target 165.43 ± 1.0) — but **k = 7 (1.17 %)**, outside
  [2.27 %, 9.09 %], with 7 cliff crossings. The instant came back and
  the rate did not. Per the branch written in advance: neither
  `/init` timing nor the netlink call is shown to explain the
  suppression, and something else changed since 04:08.
- **Post-hoc analysis of the collected data — labelled as such,
  because it is not what any of this was pre-registered to test.**
  Grouping every boot of every arm by its announce instant shows the
  events are not the low tail of one distribution. They are a
  **distinct early mode at ~156.4 ms**, about 9 ms below the clean
  median:

  | run | early-mode boots (announce < 163 ms) | of which events |
  |---|---|---|
  | pre-fix, 04:08, n=550 | 26 (4.73 %) | **25** |
  | Arm N, now, n=600 | 10 (1.67 %) | **7** |
  | validated, now, n=5000 | 7 (0.14 %), at 159.3–160 ms | 0 |
  | Arm C, now, n=600 | 3 (0.50 %), at 159.2–160 ms | 0 |
  | Arm S, now, n=600 | 1 (0.17 %), at 159.7 ms | 0 |

  The D-0074 failing boot's announce was 156.57 ms — the same mode.
  Three consequences, none of them flattering to what this entry
  concluded an hour ago.
  1. **The collision-window bound recorded above is struck.**
     "(166.3, 167.6) ms, a ~1.3 ms window" was derived from
     cross-run percentiles on the assumption that events sit in the
     low tail of the announce distribution. They sit in a separate
     mode. The bound was wrong, and it was wrong because it was
     computed from summary statistics of pooled runs rather than
     from the per-boot join that was available the whole time.
  2. **The rate is a property of the host, not of the image.** The
     early mode occurred on 4.73 % of boots at 04:08 and 1.67 % of
     boots now, on the **same source**. Both rate estimates anchored
     on that session — the 1/50 pilot and the pre-registered
     25/550 — measure how often the boot timeline lands in that
     mode on that day, not a property of `Image-trimmed`. D-0074's
     rate arithmetic and its P(campaign completes) figures inherit
     that caveat.
  3. **"0 in 5000" was really 0 in 7.** Only early-mode boots can
     collide; the other 4993 never had the opportunity. Across the
     three fix-bearing configurations the informative sample is
     **11 boots, not 6200**. Against a within-mode collision rate of
     70 % (Arm N) to 96 % (pre-fix), 0/11 is still evidence that the
     2.87 ms shift protects within the mode — but it is eleven
     boots' worth, and every statement of the form "no event in N
     thousand boots" in this log and in the report must be read with
     that denominator.
- **The three strikes, stated as strikes.**
  1. **The collision-window bound (166.3, 167.6) ms is withdrawn.**
     Not narrowed, not qualified — withdrawn. It was an artifact of
     computing from cross-run percentiles.
  2. **The event rate is reclassified as a host state.** 4.55 %
     (04:08) and 1.17 % (13:20) on the same source. Any campaign
     that needs a rate must **re-measure it on the day**, never
     inherit 25/550 or the 1/50 pilot. D-0074's P(campaign
     completes) figures are conditional on that morning's host.
  3. **"0 in 5000" is restated as "0 in 7 exposed", and the actual
     evidence base for the fix is 11 exposed boots** — the sum
     across every fix-bearing arm (validated 7, Arm C 3, Arm S 1).
     This is the correction that matters most, because it is the
     number the rest was resting on: the campaign-safety argument,
     the D-0075 validation verdict, and the decision to run T4.8b
     all quoted a denominator of thousands for a quantity that only
     eleven boots could speak to. **The fix's support is far thinner
     than the headline implied.** It is not absent — 0/11 against a
     within-mode rate of 70–96 % is real — but it is eleven boots.
- **Meta-pattern, fifth instance: the instrument existed; the
  analysis used it at the wrong grain.** Earlier entries filed this
  as attribution across a boundary. That framing was too narrow.
  The unifying failure is **grain**:
  - `W` fuses guest boot with delivery, and was attributed to
    delivery while per-phase guest stamps existed (item 17, D-0071).
  - Δ(E0→E4) ≈ Δ(`W`) was read as a delivery signature one step
    after that lesson was written down (threats item 19).
  - The optimisation projection scaled linearly from an aggregate
    whose components did not scale alike (D-0069).
  - The margin was called continuous from three points, and was
    discrete at 550 (D-0074 Outcome).
  - Here: the announce distribution was summarised by cross-run
    percentiles when the per-boot join was in `boots.jsonl` the
    whole time — and that join, applied afterwards, overturned the
    conclusion in one query.
  - (Added 2026-08-20, sixth — a subtype: D-0080's probe ran 1000×
    off its registered cadence while every gate passed; the design
    parameter, not the data, was asserted instead of checked.
    Recorded in full in D-0080's first-execution record.)
  - (Added 2026-08-20, seventh: the t47b "regime flip" diagnosis.
    The per-boot warmup rows sat in every pinned `phases.csv`, and
    the diagnosis concluded a mid-warmup flip from the canary plus
    one batch's warmups read in the wrong order. The
    warmup-position join across batches and campaigns, run one day
    later, put the deflated boot at the same structural position —
    each batch's first safe warmup — in all four campaigns, and
    refuted the flip in one table. The instrument was present the
    whole time; the analysis pooled past warmup position. See the
    D-0078 amendment refutation block and the t47c review in
    D-0079.)
  In none of these was the instrument missing. In all of them the
  analysis aggregated past the grain at which the effect lived.
  The rule this yields is stronger than the boundary corollary and
  supersedes it: **before summarising, check that the summary's
  grain is finer than the structure being claimed — and when the
  per-item data exists, join it before pooling it.**
- **What survives.** The deployed image is not worse than the
  pre-fix one on any measurement taken; the passive signature
  logging counts any recurrence; and the shift is associated with
  0 collisions in 11 exposed boots where the unshifted case gives
  70–96 %. What does **not** survive is the claim that the
  mechanism is understood, and the three numbers struck above.
- Revisit trigger: any falsifier; a QEMU, kernel or Buildroot
  change, which re-rolls the boot timeline and therefore the
  collision — if events reappear in a later campaign, the passive
  signature logging (D-0075) counts them and this entry is where to
  start. Add to that any change that makes `/init`'s pre-announce
  path faster.
- **Open item (recorded, deliberately not chased before T4.8b):
  what puts a boot into the ~156.4 ms early mode.** That is the
  actual mechanism; everything in D-0074, D-0075 and D-0076 has been
  downstream of it. The announce is ~9 ms early on those boots, so
  the divergence is upstream of `/init`'s announce and probably
  upstream of `/init` — a boot-timeline instrument (per-initcall or
  per-phase guest stamps joined per boot, D-0072's shape) is what
  would name it, and per the grain rule above it must be joined per
  boot, not pooled. Until then the honest statement is that the
  event is a property of the boot timeline, observed but not
  explained.

## D-0077: Anchor the SYN-grid gate on IPv4, and record trials that trip a gate

- Date: 2026-08-19 — Status: accepted (fix applied, verified against
  every recorded trial; T4.8b restarts from scratch on it)
- **Decision:**
  1. The SYN-grid anchor becomes
     `(arp || ip) && eth.src != 52:55:0a:00:02:02`, not
     `eth.src != 52:55:0a:00:02:02`. The invariant D-0062 states is
     the guest's first wire TX; the invariant that actually governs
     is **the first frame that can teach slirp our IPv4 MAC** — the
     ARP, or the announce datagram on a warm cache. An IPv6 frame
     populates slirp's NDP table and cannot flush a queued IPv4
     hostfwd SYN.
  2. A trial that trips a gate is **recorded before the gate
     re-raises**, to `results/gate-failures.csv`. It does not enter
     `runs.csv` and never reaches aggregation.
  3. Every trial prints its passive signature to the console.
  4. The aborted batch `20260819T135230Z-1` is **discarded, not
     resumed**; T4.8b restarts from scratch.
- **Evidence — the per-boot frame join, which named it in one look.**
  `20260819T135230Z-1 stock/29`:

  | # | t (s) | src | proto | |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 0.000000 | slirp | ARP | who-has 10.0.2.15 |
  | 2 | 0.887353 | **guest** | **ICMPv6** | **NS for fe80::5054:ff:fe12:3456 (DAD)** |
  | 3 | 0.893785 | guest | ARP | who-has 10.0.2.2 — the announce's solicit |
  | 4 | 0.893792 | slirp | ARP | reply |
  | 5 | 0.893807 | slirp | TCP | **SYN → 80, 22 µs after frame 3** |

  The SYN flushed 22 µs after the **ARP**, exactly as on every other
  trial. Had the ICMPv6 NS flushed it, the SYN would sit at 0.887.
  The gate anchored on frame 2 and reported 6.454 ms of IPv4 stack
  work as a delivery delay.
- **The bound was never the problem.** Stock's SYN-grid interval,
  measured per trial from the pcaps:

  | arm | n | min | p50 | p90 | max |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | stock, T4.8 (`ffb7ac7`) | 66 | 22 µs | **26 µs** | 27 µs | 31 µs |
  | stock, aborted T4.8b | 26 | 22 µs | 29 µs | 33 µs | 36 µs |
  | trimmed | 132 | 19 µs | 24 µs | 27 µs | 34 µs |
  | whimbrel (both) | ~800 | 13 µs | 17 µs | 22 µs | 25 µs |

  Stock flushes as promptly as everything else. The hypothesis that
  its ~897 ms first TX puts it deep enough into slirp's queue
  lifetime to change flush behaviour is **refuted**: queue lifetime
  does not affect flush latency. The 1 ms bound keeps ~28× headroom
  over the worst trial ever recorded.
- **Before/after over every recorded trial (n = 1133, all batches
  on disk).**
  - trials whose `dt` changes: **1** — `stock/29`, 6.454 ms → 22 µs
  - would fail the 1 ms gate, old anchor: **2**
  - would fail, new anchor: **1 — the D-0074 event
    (`20260818T143032Z-1 trimmed/02`, 5.023 s) still fails.** The
    detector stays armed; that was the acceptance condition.
  - all passing trials, new anchor: 13–36 µs, median 19 µs
- **Exposure asymmetry: the trim created this.** Only the stock arm
  can hit it. D-0073 unset `CONFIG_IPV6` in the trimmed fragment,
  and Whimbrel never had IPv6 at all, so stock is the **only** arm
  that emits an ICMPv6 frame. Linux jitters the DAD solicit, so it
  precedes the ARP rarely: 1 boot in 92 stock trials; in the other
  91 the only in-window IPv6 frame is an MLD report 9–11 ms *after*
  the ARP. That is why 66 T4.8 stock trials passed and why this
  looked new.
  - **The general lesson, worth more than the fix.** A gate shared
    across arms silently assumes the arms are alike in whatever the
    gate measures. Trimming one arm's kernel made them unalike in a
    dimension the gate did not name, and the gate's failure mode was
    to report the difference as a fault in the measured system.
    **Any shared gate must be re-derived when one arm's
    configuration diverges** — the trim list in D-0073 is the list
    of dimensions along which the arms are now structurally
    different, and it should be read as a list of places this can
    recur.
- **The missing-row defect, recorded as a class rather than a bug.**
  `run_trial` has **13** `raise BenchFail` sites before its
  `return {…}`, and `require_pcap_intervals` contributes 5 more
  inside that span; the row is only appended after `run_trial`
  returns. So **every** gate on the trial path drops the record of
  the trial it fails:
  - client never ready / QEMU timeout / client did not finish
  - client JSON missing / not the 92-byte RESP
  - no first-connect stamp, no first-byte stamp (E4)
  - guest panic; Linux `INIT FAIL` / `READY` missing / `LINUX INIT
    OK` missing
  - HTTP `tcp.len` ≠ 92; negative `w_ns`/`d_ack_ns`/`d_fin_ns`;
    Whimbrel `d_fin ≥ 10 ms` (D-0070 falsify line); `assert_no_rst`
    (confound B); `assert_syn_grid` (confound A)

  **A fail-closed gate that raises before the record is written
  defeats every logging requirement downstream of it.** D-0075 item
  4 promised event trials are kept and published, never dropped; it
  held for 124 ordinary trials and failed for the one trial anyone
  wanted. Recording before re-raising is the general repair, and it
  is placed at the single call site rather than at 18 raise sites.
  - Not in this class: `check_linux_artifacts` (a batch-start
    precondition — there is no trial to record) and
    `linux_kernel_hash_failures` (a post-hoc pass over rows already
    written).
- **The instrument that looked absent.** The passive signature was
  wired correctly and did record per trial — `runs.csv` was rewritten
  after every trial and survived the abort with 124 rows and
  populated `guest_ftx_ns`. It emitted nothing to the console, so it
  read as broken. An instrument nobody can see is one nobody checks;
  the per-trial line is part of the fix, not decoration.
- **Alternatives considered.**
  - **Raise the 1 ms bound.** Rejected: the bound is correct and has
    28× headroom; raising it to cover a 6.45 ms artifact would blind
    the gate to real sub-cliff delivery stalls, which is the one
    thing it exists for.
  - **Exclude IPv6 by name** (`&& !ipv6`). Rejected as a denylist:
    it fixes today's protocol and not tomorrow's. `(arp || ip)`
    states the requirement positively.
  - **Drop IPv6 from stock too.** Rejected outright: stock is the
    unmodified board defconfig, and modifying it to suit our gate
    would destroy the only arm whose configuration we do not choose.
  - **Write gate-failing trials into `runs.csv` with a flag.**
    Rejected: they are not measurements, and every consumer would
    need to learn to filter them. A separate file cannot pollute
    aggregation by omission.
  - **Resume the aborted batch.** Rejected: D-0055 requires whole
    interleaved shuffled batches; a resumed batch is a different
    randomisation and its trials were recorded under the old anchor.
- **Consequences.**
  1. `results/gate-failures.csv` is new. It is diagnostic, never
     aggregated, and its absence is not an error. It is **ignored**
     in `results/.gitignore`: `git_identity()` reads
     `git status --porcelain` once at batch start, which includes
     untracked files, so a leftover from an aborted campaign would
     otherwise stamp `dirty=1` on every row of the next one and make
     it unaggregatable.
  2. `pcap_http.py`'s anchor changes for all consumers
     (`bench.py`, `d0070-pcap-pass.py`, `linux-boot-test.sh` via the
     harness). Verified to change exactly one trial in 1133.
  3. T4.8b's batch id changes; `20260819T135230Z-1` remains on disk
     as the aborted attempt and is named in the report as such.
  4. Console output gains one line per trial.
- Revisit trigger: any further divergence between arms' kernel
  configurations (each one is a candidate for the same class of
  gate assumption); or a libslirp change to how the guest MAC is
  learned, which is what the new anchor encodes.

## D-0078: Serial-byte cost is an uncontrolled per-boot host variable

- Date: 2026-08-19 — Status: accepted (measured; the control gap is
  named in D-0055 terms; threats item 21 carries the reader-facing
  statement)
- **Decision:**
  1. The cost of one guest serial byte (DBCN ecall → OpenSBI LSR
     poll → 16550 MMIO → QEMU chardev `write(2)` to the serial
     file) is a **per-boot host variable**, not a constant of the
     platform. Between T4.8 (host boot of Aug 17 17:26) and T4.8b
     (host boot of Aug 19 02:24) it stepped from ~5.8 to ~6.8
     µs/byte (+17 %), with the kernel, QEMU binary, argv, pins and
     governor all byte-for-byte identical.
  2. Numbers that contain in-window console output are therefore
     comparable across campaigns **only with a same-day control**.
     The T4.8b exhibit says so where the safe column appears.
  3. Two additions are recommended for D-0055's control list —
     **recorded, not clamped**: per-batch cpuidle residency deltas,
     and one release-default canary boot per campaign whose PHASE
     deltas make the day's serial-cost regime visible in the
     artifacts. Clamping C-states is *not* adopted (below).
- **Evidence — growth strictly proportional to bytes printed.** The
  safe profile emits 13,117 serial bytes inside its measured window;
  fast-boot emits 0 (its 4,975 bytes print after the response,
  D-0068). Per-phase growth T4.8 → T4.8b against bytes printed in
  that phase's delta:

  | phase | bytes in delta | growth | implied cost |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | stvec | ~134 | +0.142 ms | 1.06 µs/B |
  | page_verify | ~4,250 | +4.255 ms | 1.00 µs/B |
  | virtq_init | ~2,049 | +2.147 ms | 1.05 µs/B |
  | whole window (`w_ns` 86.44 → 99.44) | 13,117 | +13.00 ms | 0.99 µs/B |

  The non-movers are the controls:
  - **`frame_init`, 30.5 ms, moved 0.0 %** — its delta contains the
    `ticks() < 3` `wfi` wait, which is mtime-anchored: print time
    spent before it is absorbed by the wait. A zero exactly where a
    wall-clock anchor predicts one.
  - **fast-boot, every phase 1.00×** (E0→E4 52.28 → 51.87 ms) —
    zero in-window bytes.
  - **stock, E0→E4 948.11 → 948.10 ms across campaigns** — ~900 ms
    of TCG, virtio, slirp and hostfwd, moved 0.01 ms. This is the
    parity control that excludes general host drift, thermals, TCG
    speed and slirp behaviour in one number. What moved is the
    serial byte, and only the serial byte.
- **When it stepped.** Safe-profile deltas recovered from PHASE
  lines across all 17 on-disk batches and four host boots: stable at
  stvec 1.01–1.03 / page_verify 11.6–13.2 ms through Aug 17–18
  (three host boots, twelve batches, including the 14:30Z abort in
  the boot of Aug 18 09:58); stepped to 1.17–1.18 / 16.1–16.2 in
  the boot of Aug 19 02:24 and flat within it. No kernel, microcode
  or QEMU package change in `dpkg.log` between the campaigns; two
  reboots between them.
- **Launcher exonerated by same-day A/B.** All normal batches had
  been user-launched and all inflated batches agent-launched, a
  perfect confound. Closed 2026-08-19: the same release-default
  boot-test run minutes apart from both shells —

  | | stvec | page_verify | virtq_init | frame_init |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | user shell | 1.214 | 17.62 | 9.94 | 30.377 |
  | agent shell | 1.219 | 18.31 | 10.02 | 30.361 |

  Both squarely in the inflated regime, matching to a few percent,
  `frame_init` flat in both. (Unpinned boot-test runs sit ~10 %
  above campaign values; the regimes are ~40 % apart, so the verdict
  does not depend on that.) Foreground and `setsid nohup` launches
  had already matched exactly, and the agent cgroup carries no
  cpu/memory/io limits.
- **The cpuidle hypothesis — what would be checked, and why it is
  not being clamped.** Host: `acpi_idle`/`menu`, states POLL / C1
  (1 µs) / C2 (18 µs) / C3 (350 µs exit latency), all enabled;
  cmdline has no idle controls; D-0055 controls cover governor, SMT,
  boost, steal — **not cpuidle**. Load was 0.52 during T4.8 and 0.18
  during T4.8b, so the *quieter* host was the slower one — the right
  sign for wakeup latency, the wrong sign for contention. The check
  that discriminates, read-only: per-CPU
  `cpuidle/state*/{usage,time}` deltas across one safe boot, on the
  QEMU CPU and on the unpinned CPUs that host QEMU's non-vCPU
  threads. Deep-state residency during the boot that correlates
  with the inflated regime confirms it; flat residency refutes it
  and points back at the write path. Not run to completion here: one
  half of the comparison needs a host boot that is back in the
  normal regime, which cannot be produced on demand without changing
  host state. Clamping (`processor.max_cstate=1`, `cpuidle.off=1`,
  or per-state `disable`) is rejected for now: it changes the
  thermal and frequency envelope of the whole campaign to fix a
  path that the measured profile does not exercise — record first,
  clamp only if a recorded correlation earns it.
- **Why the mechanism can sit below the byte and still be honest.**
  ~1 µs per byte is the measured *symptom*; whether it is the
  chardev `write(2)`, the MMIO exit, or a timer wakeup between them
  is not established, and the entry does not pretend otherwise. The
  grain rule cuts both ways: the per-byte law is established at the
  grain of phases×bytes; the syscall-level attribution would need a
  finer instrument (`perf`/ftrace on the host, out of scope here).
- **Alternatives considered.** Clamp C-states in D-0055 (rejected
  above); declare the safe profile unmeasurable (overreach — it is
  measurable within a day, which is how D-0055 uses it); anchor all
  campaigns to a reference boot via a scaling factor (rejected: a
  correction factor derived from the thing being corrected is the
  D-0069 shape).
- **Consequences.**
  1. Threats item 21 (both report files) carries the exposure list
     and the reader warning.
  2. The T4.8b cross-system exhibit lands with a same-day scoping
     note on its safe row, and cites stock 948.11 → 948.10 as the
     demonstrated cross-campaign parity control.
  3. `arp-signature`'s per-arm design is unaffected (it compares
     within arm, within campaign).
- **Act-on + correction (2026-08-19, same day).** The canary is
  implemented: one release-default boot before trial 1 of every
  campaign invocation (`bench.py cmd_run`), its `stvec` /
  `page_verify` deltas printed to the console and written into the
  batch header (`summary.txt`) beside `s_ns`; fail-closed if the
  boot yields no PHASE dump (`canary_values`), with the failure
  recorded to `gate-failures.csv`. Spec: **Bench-host spec
  (D-0078)** in `results/README.md`.
  - **Its first two executions corrected this entry.** Seven
    minutes apart on the same host boot they read 1.024 / 11.80 ms
    (normal) and 1.170 / 16.26 ms (inflated). "Per-boot" was
    over-claimed from the 17-batch series: the state **fluctuates
    on a minutes timescale**, and the series looked per-boot only
    because each campaign happened to sit inside one regime for its
    duration (the tight within-campaign IQRs show that uniformity).
    The load correlation now has three legs, all the same sign —
    busy host fast (T4.8, load 0.52, normal), idle host slow
    (T4.8b, load 0.18, inflated), and the flips landing right after
    vs. away from bursts of host activity — which is the C-state
    signature, still a hypothesis.
  - **Retrospective per-trial check (same day): neither campaign
    flipped mid-run.** Safe-arm `page_verify` joined per trial
    against `run_order`, both campaigns: T4.8 n=60 span 0.364 ms,
    largest sorted gap 0.076 ms; T4.8b n=60 span 0.651 ms, largest
    gap 0.103 ms — against a regime separation of ~4.3 ms, i.e. the
    biggest within-campaign gap is 40–56× too small to be a flip.
    First-half vs second-half medians differ by ≤ 0.034 ms and the
    quartile medians over run_order are flat. "Each campaign sat
    inside one regime" is now verified at trial grain, not inferred
    from IQRs, and it bounds flip frequency: none in 2 × ~40 min of
    campaign against two flips seen in ~10 min of idle desktop —
    consistent with the load-correlation hypothesis (campaigns keep
    the host busy).
  - **Consequence for the control.** A start-of-campaign canary is
    necessary but not sufficient; a mid-campaign flip is the
    residual risk. For campaign kinds that include the safe arm
    (whimbrel, t48) the arm itself is the continuous monitor — a
    flip shows as bimodal safe-profile deltas in `phases.csv`,
    checkable post-hoc at trial grain. The canary's job is to name
    the starting regime in the header so no reader has to
    reconstruct it from the trials.
- **AMENDMENT (drafted 2026-08-19, not yet adopted — trigger: t47b).
  The canary cannot certify a campaign's regime; the authoritative
  record is the exposed arm's per-trial witness.**
  - **Trigger evidence.** t47b's canary read 1.039 / 12.070 ms
    (deflated); all 60 recorded safe-arm trials ran inflated
    (`page_verify` 15.85–16.51 ms, uniform). The warmups captured
    the transition itself: the first safe warmup read **11.85 ms —
    deflated, agreeing with the canary** — the second read 16.28,
    and every boot after stayed inflated. So the canary was
    *correct at its instant*; what failed is reading one instant as
    a campaign certificate. This also settles the mechanism among
    the three candidates: not a canary-conditions artifact (the
    first trial-conditions boot agreed with it), not
    single-sampling of an intra-campaign wobble (the recorded
    trials are uniform); it is a **genuine regime flip inside the
    warmup window**, the mid-campaign-flip residual risk this entry
    named, observed one page earlier than feared.
  - **Trigger evidence REFUTED (2026-08-20, t47c review — the text
    above stands as written and is struck by this block, per the
    disclosure rule).** The flip reading kept the wrong boot order:
    **11.85 ms was batch-2's first warmup**, mid-campaign. Batch
    1's warmups — the boots seconds after the 12.070 canary — read
    **16.28 / 16.32 / 16.21, inflated**. The canary was **not**
    correct at its instant, and there was no regime flip inside the
    warmup window. We adopted a mechanism that the data on disk
    already contradicted: the per-boot warmup rows sat in every
    pinned `phases.csv` the whole time, and nobody joined warmup
    *position* before concluding — the grain pattern, instance 7 in
    its list. The join, run across every pinned campaign
    (safe-arm `page_verify`, ms; dips bold):

    | campaign | canary | batch-1 warmups | batch-2 warmups | recorded |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | t48b | (pre-canary) | 16.32 16.22 16.46 | **11.78** 16.06 16.24 | inflated 16.16/16.13 |
    | t47  | console-only | **12.11** 16.43 16.11 | **11.91** 16.52 16.64 | inflated 16.42/16.41 |
    | t47b | 12.070 | 16.28 16.32 16.21 | **11.85** 16.16 16.10 | inflated 16.14/16.13 |
    | t47c | 12.007 | **11.84** 15.95 16.02 | **12.06** 16.42 16.09 | inflated 16.25/16.13 |

    **What the join establishes — recorded as structure, no
    mechanism proposed:** (a) every batch-2 first safe warmup in
    all four campaigns, every canary ever taken, and every lone
    e0drift witness boot falls in **[11.76, 12.14] ms** — one
    tight cluster (the exhibit generator, seeing only pins,
    derives **[11.78, 12.11] ms** from the 8 pinned boots; this
    entry's range also includes host-only e0drift witness boots
    that are in no pin — provenance difference, not a
    discrepancy); batch-1 first warmups dip in two of four;
    (b) the dipped boots sat behind 0.7–0.8 s gaps, identical to
    their inflated neighbors — **wall-clock spacing is refuted as
    the driver**; (c) the m-lane dips at the same position (t47c
    batch-2 first warmup 7.18 ms against a steady 10.85) — the
    effect **survives removing both OpenSBI and DBCN**, so it
    lives on the host's polled-UART path, not the SBI console.
    The canary therefore measures a reproducible *structural*
    state — whatever a batch-boundary first boot shares with a
    lone boot — and not the campaign's serial regime. Its
    demotion in this amendment is strengthened accordingly.
    Mechanism unknown, deliberately not guessed; the table is the
    evidence.
  - **Carve-out re-draft (drafted 2026-08-20, not adopted):** the
    amendment's uniformity clause (classification item 3 and the
    regime-mixed salvage rule, item 5) tests **recorded trials
    only**. Warmup rows at batch-boundary positions — each batch's
    first warmup of an arm — are excluded from the uniformity test
    and recorded as the structural dip. A campaign whose only
    sub-divide readings sit at those positions is **not**
    regime-mixed. Without this carve-out, a normal batch-boundary
    dip reads as regime-mixed and aborts a sound campaign for
    nothing.
  - **Reconciliation, every campaign with committed CSVs:** the
    table is a **generated exhibit, never typed** —
    [`report/exhibits/regime-witness.md`](../report/exhibits/regime-witness.md),
    regenerated by `python3 scripts/regime-witness.py` from the
    pinned CSVs, grouped by kernel family (`kernel_sha256` of the
    safe arm) because witness absolutes compare only within one
    family. Summary of what it shows: eight campaigns, the witness
    uniform within every one, the current-family clusters
    separating cleanly (~11.7–12.2 vs ~16.1–16.4 ms), one canary
    agreement (t47) and one disagreement (t47b) — the evidence that
    the witness works and the canary cannot certify.
  - **What was certified on a canary reading: nothing published.**
    Only two campaigns ever had a canary — t47 (agreed) and t47b
    (disagreed; aborted and unpublished regardless). **t48b
    specifically: no canary existed for it** — its inflated
    classification, and every published statement resting on regime
    (threats item 21's reading of the t48↔t48b safe-arm +15.8 ms as
    the day's serial cost; this entry's regime narrative), was
    derived from the per-trial witness — the instrument this
    reconciliation validates. No published number rests on a canary.
  - **Proposed instrument change (not implemented).**
    1. The **authoritative regime record is the witness**: the
       recorded per-trial deltas of any in-window-printing arm,
       computed from the campaign's pinned `phases.csv` — no new
       columns needed. Classification requires uniformity (all
       recorded trials on one side of the kernel-relative divide);
       a mixed witness marks the campaign regime-mixed and its
       exposed numbers unpublishable as a single regime.
    2. The **canary demotes to pre-flight sanity**: it keeps the
       fail-closed no-PHASE-dump abort and its columns keep being
       recorded, but nothing certifies on it.
    3. The **exhibit same-campaign gate** reads, from the pin: both
       lanes in one batch set (unchanged), canary columns present
       (sanity that the pre-flight ran), and the **witness**
       computed from `phases.csv` for classification and
       uniformity — instead of the canary values.
    4. **The no-safe-arm hole closes itself**: an arm is
       regime-exposed iff it prints in-window, and any printing
       whimbrel arm is its own witness — so a campaign with no
       printing arm (fp-ab: two fast variants, zero in-window
       bytes) has no regime-exposed number and needs no witness. A
       campaign whose only printing arm writes no PHASE rows
       (Linux `trimmed-instrumented`) must include the whimbrel
       safe arm as witness — the t48 shape already does — or its
       printing cells are marked regime-unclassified.
    5. **A regime-mixed campaign is not a total loss — what
       survives is stated by the exposure criterion.** The t47b
       flip landed between warmups 1 and 2 by luck; a flip at
       recorded trial 40 would be caught by the witness's
       uniformity requirement only after the full campaign ran.
       In that case: every **printing arm's** number is
       regime-mixed and unpublishable as a single-regime quantity
       (safe rows, observer-cost-type cells); every **non-printing
       arm's** number is unaffected on the serial axis by the same
       criterion that defines exposure — zero in-window bytes —
       so the fast pair's claims (ΔE2→E3g, per-batch ΔE0→E4 under
       design (d)) stand. The witness is post-hoc; a mixed finding
       demotes cells, it does not abort a completed run.
    6. **Canary train — drafted, not adopted.** Replace the single
       pre-flight boot with **N = 5** back-to-back release-default
       boots (~12 s). Agreement criterion: all five `page_verify`
       deltas on one side of the kernel family's regime divide
       *and* spanning ≤ 1 ms; the train's median is the recorded
       starting regime. On disagreement, one full-train retry;
       a second disagreement aborts before trial 1 (fail-closed,
       and cheaper than a campaign whose starting state was
       already flapping). The train remains pre-flight sanity —
       the witness stays authoritative — but it converts "one
       instant" into "an instant known to be stable for ~12 s",
       which is what t47b's canary lacked.
    7. Named, not adopted: the train doubles as the discriminator
       for any future canary/witness disagreement whose warmups
       did not capture the flip.
- Revisit trigger: any future campaign whose canary boot lands
  outside a known regime; **bimodal or canary-contradicting
  safe-profile deltas within one campaign (observed: t47b, in the
  warmup window)**; a host kernel or QEMU change touching the
  chardev path; or adoption of the residency recording, which
  supersedes the manual A/B this entry rests on.

## D-0079: T4.7 act-on — the `-bios none` shim, its diagnosis channels, and S

- Date: 2026-08-19 — Status: accepted (executes D-0061; verify-items
  done before any shim code; checkpoint 0 and the skeleton land with
  this entry, the seams and the campaign lane land after it)
- **Decision:** build D-0061's variant in this order, each step with a
  pre-registered observable:
  1. **Checkpoint 0** — a build (`mshim-exit0`) whose first
     instruction stores PASS to sifive_test: QEMU exits 0 with no
     serial, no UART assumptions, nothing. The smallest possible
     proof that `-bios none` executed our bytes at `0x8000_0000`.
  2. **Skeleton** (`bios-none`) — the full CSR program, checkpoint
     letters, both trap diagnostics, `mret` to the unmodified
     `_start`. **Pre-registered stop point:** the kernel's first SBI
     call (`require_dbcn` probe) lands in the shim's `mtvec`
     diagnostic as cause 9 — proving shim, PMP, counteren
     (two `rdtime` stamps execute first), delegation of everything
     *but* cause 9, and `mret`, all in one line of serial.
  3. Seams per D-0061's allowlist (console, timer, shutdown, two
     mappings), then `just test-m`, then the paired campaign.
- **The shim's CSR program (before `mret`):** `pmpaddr0=-1`,
  `pmpcfg0=NAPOT|RWX` (0x1F); `medeleg=0xf4b509`, `mideleg=0x1666` —
  **copied verbatim from OpenSBI's banner**, because the kernel was
  validated under exactly those values and a hand-derived mask is a
  second implementation of a thing we can transcribe (the surplus
  H-extension bits are inert); `mcounteren=-1` (the kernel's first
  instruction is `rdtime`); `menvcfg.STCE=1` (the D-0018 seam);
  `mcountinhibit=0`; `mie=0`; `mtvec` → M diagnostic; `stvec` → S
  diagnostic (the amendment below); `mstatus.MPP=S`;
  `mepc=_start`; `a0`/`a1` preserved end to end.
- **Amendment to D-0061, found during execution planning — not scope
  drift.** D-0061 specified park-with-diagnostic on `mtvec` so that
  "any M-mode trap is a bug and says so". That handler **structurally
  cannot fire on the two worst bring-up failures.** With full
  delegation (which D-0061 also specifies), a missing PMP entry
  faults the *first S-mode instruction fetch*, and a clear
  `mcounteren.TM` makes the kernel's *first instruction* (`rdtime`)
  illegal — both are delegated exception causes, so they route to
  `stvec`, which at that instant is 0: the trap vectors to address
  0, faults again, and loops. Silent, and `mtvec` never hears of it.
  The amendment: **the shim preloads `stvec`** with a tiny S-mode
  diagnostic stub inside the shim segment (executable under the PMP
  catch-all, reachable under Bare translation) that prints
  `scause`/`sepc`/`stval` and parks. It costs nothing at runtime and
  the kernel overwrites it at `trap::install` exactly as it
  overwrites OpenSBI's leftover today. Every failure in the
  bring-up taxonomy now has a loud channel: image-not-loaded →
  checkpoint 0's exit code; M traps → `mtvec` diagnostic; pre-kmain
  S traps → `stvec` preload; post-paging faults → the kernel's own
  fail-loud handler.
- **Verify-item (a), done empirically before any code: the FDT does
  not move.** QEMU `-bios none`, gdb stub, break at `0x8000_0000`:
  `a0=0`, `a1=0x87e00000`, magic `0xd00dfeed` present — byte-for-byte
  the address the OpenSBI lane reports as Next Arg1, i.e. QEMU
  places the FDT and OpenSBI was passing it through. D-0065's
  clobberable-DTB assumption holds identically in both lanes. Per
  the sign-off it becomes a **boot assert, not a hope**:
  `frame::check_dtb` panics unless `dtb_pa ≥ heap_end()` — the
  containment that makes clobbering legal — in both lanes, landing
  with the seam commit (consequence 3 explains the deferral).
- **Verify-item (b), by analysis: the D-0068 yield survives Sstc,
  strengthened.** `timer::yield_once` depends on two properties:
  re-arming clears stale STIP, and `wfi` wakes on STIP-pending with
  `sstatus.SIE=0`. Under SBI TIME the first is OpenSBI behaviour
  (it clears `mip.STIP` when the new deadline is future); under
  Sstc, `sip.STIP` is *architecturally defined* as the read-only
  reflection of `stimecmp ≤ time`, so writing a future deadline
  clears it by definition — the property upgrades from firmware
  contract to ISA. The second is mechanism-blind. Finding 13's
  `assert_ticks_armed` checks `sie.STIE` only and holds unchanged;
  the safe profile's boot tick-wait takes interrupts through
  `mideleg` bit 5, which the transcribed `0x1666` delegates.
- **Binding gate, not a note: the with/without pair is one
  campaign.** Per D-0078 the serial-byte regime moves on a minutes
  timescale between campaigns and is uniform within them (verified
  at trial grain). The firmware exhibit therefore **refuses** any
  pair whose two lanes come from different campaigns: both lanes
  interleaved in one invocation, one canary in the shared batch
  header, or the exhibit does not generate. This is a validator
  check in the future exhibit code, the same shape as the
  batch-set checks in `validate_t48`.
- **What happens to S — answered now, not discovered later.** S
  (D-0071) is the pre-ARP QEMU-startup slice,
  `(E4 − first_connect) − pcap(ARP→FIN)`, ~6.8–6.9 ms on this host
  for Whimbrel, and **guest-image load lands in S** (D-0062). Under
  `-bios none` QEMU no longer loads the 321 KB `fw_dynamic` blob, so
  S shrinks by that load; the shim adds ~a hundred bytes to the ELF,
  which does not register. Expected: **ΔS = S_default − S_variant in
  (+0.1, +1.5) ms.** Because S sits on the E0 side of every edge,
  the variant's E0→E4 improvement decomposes as **guest firmware
  execution removed + ΔS (host-side firmware load removed) + seam
  deltas** — both of the first two are honestly firmware cost, but
  they are different kinds of cost, and the exhibit reports them as
  separate terms: per-lane `s_ns` quoted from the shared batch
  header, ΔE0→E4 alongside ΔS. The D-0062/D-0071 pooling rule
  extends: **S is never pooled across lanes** — same host, same
  ELF-size class, different startup work, two populations by
  construction. Falsifiers on S: ΔS < −0.3 ms (the variant made
  startup *slower*: unmodelled cost, stop) or |ΔS| > 3 ms
  (startup changed beyond the firmware-load model; the E0-side of
  the comparison is contaminated and no firmware saving is published
  until it is explained). The first-connect control needs no new
  gate: with both lanes interleaved in one batch, the existing
  ≤ 1 ms span check is automatically cross-lane.
- **Pre-registered projection (fast-boot E0→E4, variant lane).**
  From t48b: E0→E4 51.87 ms, E2→E3g 6.38 ms, E3g→E4 ≈ 1.3–1.5 ms →
  E0→E2 ≈ 44 ms = QEMU startup/load (~18–20 ms; the 18.5 ms
  first-connect control is the listener-up analogue) + OpenSBI
  (blob load + init + ~13 ms banner UART + jump) ≈ 24–26 ms.
  **Orientation range 24–34 ms, expectation ~28 ms** (point
  prediction refused, D-0069). **Falsifiers (stop, publish no
  saving):**
  1. Variant fast E0→E4 ≥ 51.87 ms — no improvement.
  2. |Δ E2→E3g| > 0.5 ms against the same-campaign default lane —
     the seams leaked beyond D-0061's allowlist (abandon criterion
     (a) in measurable form).
  3. Any M-mode trap after `mret`, in any gate or trial — the
     `mtvec` diagnostic firing *is* the falsifier.
  4. Any `test-m` gate that passes on `-bios default` and fails on
     the variant.
  5. The `-bios default` cross-system rows move at all.
  6. D-0061's abandon criterion (b) with numbers: saving < 2× the
     largest remaining S-mode rung (2 × `virtq_init` 0.84 ms ≈
     1.7 ms). Projection clears it by ~14×; a measurement under it
     abandons the variant and writes up the partial result.
  Plus the two S falsifiers above.
- **Measurement framing (restating D-0061, plus what postdates
  it):** variant, never replacement — `-bios default` keeps every
  gate and every primary number; the cross-system table's Whimbrel
  rows stay OpenSBI; Linux structurally cannot take this rung and
  the exhibit says that asymmetry is the finding. The variant's
  console is polled S-mode UART, so its per-byte serial cost is a
  different quantity **by construction**: safe-profile numbers
  never compare across lanes, and the comparison profile is
  fast-boot (zero in-window bytes). E2 ≈ E1 in the variant; its
  firmware row is ~0 by construction and the exhibit says so.
- **Execution amendment to D-0061's "second LOAD segment", found at
  the skeleton commit: the shim ships through QEMU's `-bios` slot,
  not as an ELF segment.** LLD (the target's linker) assigns
  sections to PT_LOADs in address order and pads same-flag gaps in
  the file: a `.mshim` at `0x8000_0000` beside `.text` at
  `0x8020_0000` produced one 2.1 MB LOAD with ~2 MB of zero
  padding — load bytes the variant's S would pay for, firing this
  entry's own ΔS falsifier on a linker artifact. Script placement
  does not change this (LLD sorts by address) and `PHDRS` would
  rewrite the default image's program headers, breaking
  byte-identity. Instead: the `bios-none` build is a **donor ELF**;
  `objcopy -O binary --only-section=.mshim` extracts a 320-byte
  blob, and the lane boots `-bios mshim.bin -kernel <default
  kernel>`. This is stronger than the original design on every
  axis: the shim occupies the machine's actual firmware interface
  (`QEMU_BIOS` was already the one argv knob), there is no padding,
  and **the S-mode kernel booted at skeleton stage is the
  byte-identical campaign binary** — `801cae40…`, not a variant
  build. `-bios none` never appears; the shim *is* the bios.
- **Skeleton result (pre-registered stop point, hit exactly).**
  Checkpoint 0: 20-byte blob, QEMU exits 0, zero serial. Skeleton:
  `ZPDCTVM` then `M! …0009 …80208bba …0000` — cause 9 at the
  kernel's `require_dbcn` probe, under the default kernel. One
  serial line covering every block in the taxonomy.
- **Consequences.**
  1. Cargo features `bios-none` (donor ELF carrying `.mshim`) and
     `mshim-exit0` (checkpoint 0). Neither is a campaign image;
     the lane boots the **default** kernel plus the extracted blob.
  2. `linker.ld` gains the `.mshim` output section (donor only;
     empty otherwise) and the default images are verified
     **byte-identical** (`801cae40…`/`1e43a310…` unchanged); the
     `mod mshim;` declaration sits at the end of `main.rs` because
     a cfg'd module higher up shifts every panic-location line
     number below it and moves the hash.
  3. `frame::check_dtb` gains the `dtb_pa ≥ heap_end()` assert in
     both lanes **when the seams land** — deferred from this commit
     precisely because the skeleton's value is booting the
     byte-identical kernel; the assert goes in the seam commit
     where the kernel changes anyway, and the new sha is recorded
     there. Campaigns pin their kernel sha per trial row, so
     nothing published is affected either way.
  4. `scripts/qemu-args.sh` already honours `QEMU_BIOS`; no argv
     change. The `.cargo/config.toml` runner stays `-bios default`.
  5. Bring-up symptom→cause pairs go to `docs/DEBUGGING.md` as they
     occur (house rule); **M-mode shim** goes to the glossary.
- **Seams landed (2026-08-19, same day). `just test-m` passes:
  boot, net, HTTP, fast-release under the shim.** Per seam, what
  proves it *ran* versus what proves it *worked* — they are not the
  same thing, and each divergence has a named detector:
  - **Console (DBCN → polled NS16550A).** Ran = bytes appear.
    Worked = every marker greps *exactly* — the gates compare
    content, not presence, so a dropped or corrupted byte breaks a
    `TEST PASS` grep. The one failure that cannot print its own
    panic (post-`satp` store to an unmapped UART page, since the
    panic path is the console) is caught earlier by design: `verify`
    walks the UART PTE **before** `activate`, while translation is
    Bare and the console still works.
  - **Timer (SBI TIME → `stimecmp`).** Ran = the `csrw` does not
    trap (a missing `menvcfg.STCE` is an illegal instruction, loud
    at the S vector — D-0018's observability argument restored by a
    different channel). Worked = ticks are **taken**, which
    wake-by-pending cannot prove: the D-0068 `wfi` yield returns on
    STIP-pending whether or not delivery works, so fast-boot alone
    would pass with broken `mideleg`. The default image's
    `tick 1..3` boot wait is the taken-interrupt proof, and it is in
    `test-m`'s first gate; it hangs the boot loudly if delivery
    breaks.
  - **Shutdown (SRST → sifive_test).** Ran = the store executes (an
    unmapped device page faults loudly in the kernel handler).
    Worked = **QEMU exits 0**, which `boot-test` requires for PASS —
    a wrong value writes cleanly, returns, parks the guest, and
    fails as a 124 HANG. The divergence is structural and the gate
    covers it without new code.
  - **Mappings (UART + sifive_test pages).** Ran = `tables_used()`
    equals the variant's `EXPECTED_TABLES` (6: sifive_test needs an
    L0 under L1[0]; the UART page shares the existing MMIO L0).
    Worked = the pre-activate software walk prints both rows `ok`
    and `assert_range` covers the interiors — again before `satp`,
    for the console reason above.
  - **The missed call site the taxonomy caught:** the first full
    boot died at cause 9 in the shim's M diagnostic — `sys_write`
    called `sbi::console_write_byte` directly, a second copy of the
    console backend on the syscall path. Routed through the one
    `console::put_byte`. The diagnostic named it in one line, which
    is the bisection chain doing its job on the first real bug.
  - First observation for the campaign's falsifier 2: lane fast-boot
    E2→E3g **5.98 ms** vs the OpenSBI lane's 6.38 — the seams
    removed ~0.4 ms of SBI ecall overhead (probes and per-tick
    `set_timer`) from guest work. Within the 0.5 ms budget, but
    measured cross-day; the binding comparison is the same-campaign
    pair.
  - The `check_dtb` assert landed with the seams as planned;
    default-lane kernel hashes moved `801cae40…` → `1e654985…`
    (release-default) and `1e43a310…` → `e5e30413…` (fast-boot),
    from the assert plus panic-location line shifts (DEBUGGING.md
    records the lesson). `just test` and `just test-fast-release`
    pass on the new default binaries; campaigns pin per trial row.
  - One feature split found necessary at first boot: `mshim` (the
    donor whose `.mshim` becomes the blob) is **disjoint** from
    `bios-none` (the lane kernel with the seams) — QEMU refuses to
    boot the donor under its own blob (overlapping regions), which
    now serves as the guard against mixing them.
- **Campaign outcome (2026-08-19, t47 batches `20260819T164056Z-1/-2`).
  Falsifier 2 fired; no saving is published from this run.** Two
  attempts, disclosed per the D-0074 abort policy: the first aborted
  at run_order 80 on a teardown race in the shutdown seam (the
  sifive_test store requests exit on QEMU's main loop; the vCPU
  raced into the caller's failure panic on 1 of ~80 trials — the
  store now parks in `wfi` and the fix is verified by `test-m` plus
  five repetitions; the aborted trial's gate-failure row shows a
  clean measurement signature, which is how a teardown race was
  distinguishable from a measurement fault in one row). Second
  attempt: 240 recorded trials, stability PASS on all four arms,
  steal 0, zero gate failures, no M-mode trap in any serial, canary
  1.188 / 16.07 ms in the shared header (inflated regime), blob
  `1698b114…` stamped in every shim row's `bios_sha256`.
  - **The numbers, recorded but not published:** fast E0→E4
    54.27 ms (OpenSBI) vs **28.77 ms** (shim) — Δ −25.50 ms, and
    28.77 sits in the pre-registered 24–34 ms band almost exactly on
    the ~28 expectation. W(m-fast) = 1.28 ms against 26.60: the
    entire guest boot now fits inside W, the measured form of
    D-0061's "E2 ≈ E1". ΔS on the anchor-comparable fast pair =
    **+0.161 ms**, inside the pre-registered (+0.1, +1.5) window —
    the removed `fw_dynamic` load, visible exactly where the model
    put it.
  - **Falsifier 2 fired: |Δ E2→E3g| = 0.717 ms > 0.5 (m-fast
    5.728 vs fast 6.445).** The per-phase join attributes it
    completely: `stvec` −223 µs (the removed DBCN probe), 
    `frame_init` −75 µs (the removed TIME probe and first arm),
    `E3g` −524 µs (the per-event timer-arm site in the serving
    window); every non-seam phase moved ≤ 13 µs. The seams did not
    leak — **the falsifier measured the wrong null.** It was set
    assuming the seam swaps were cost-neutral, but removing SBI
    ecall overhead is precisely what replacing the firmware
    interface does; the 0.5 ms budget was calibrated against a
    cross-day −0.40 ms reading and D-0069 predicts exactly that
    optimism. Per the registration the verdict stands: **stop,
    publish no saving.** The amendment that would unblock — rescope
    falsifier 2 to bound non-seam phases only (|Δ| > 50 µs in any
    phase without a seam call site), with the E2→E3g shift disclosed
    as part of the firmware-interface removal — is written here
    before being taken, and is not adopted until signed off.
  - **Open item: S does not transfer to the shim-safe arm.** Default
    lane S is profile-independent (7.11 / 7.03 ms); the shim lane is
    not (m-fast 6.95, m-safe **5.06** — 1.9 ms low). The same-day
    profile-independence check (an extrapolation added with the
    lane-aware header, not a D-0079 pre-registration) caught it and
    is now informational with the anomaly flagged inline: shim-lane
    S has no consumer, and the ΔS falsifiers ride on the clean fast
    pair. Named, not chased.
  - **Open observation, D-0078-adjacent:** OpenSBI-lane fast E0→E4
    read 51.87 in t48b and 54.27 in t47, same host boot, both
    campaigns in the inflated canary regime — and t47's own batches
    split 2.83 ms on that arm an hour apart (stability correction
    below): the same observation one level stronger, within one
    campaign, banner-carrying arm only, shim arm flat. Fast-boot
    prints nothing in its window — but **OpenSBI's ~2.7 KB banner is
    in-window console output for E0→E4**, an exposure threats item
    21 does not list. Candidate explanation only (the safe arm's
    +0.9 ms does not scale with it cleanly); recorded for item 21's
    next revision, not concluded.
- **Console bytes are a fourth seam effect — mechanism confirmed in
  general, refuted for the anomaly it was proposed to explain
  (2026-08-19).** Tested per sign-off before pinning any threshold.
  - **Direct count, fast profile (the falsifier-2 comparator):** the
    entire in-window guest output is `HTTP READY` — 12 bytes on the
    OpenSBI lane (DBCN CRLF-translates) vs 11 under the shim — and
    it lands inside the `established→E3g` window, which the seam set
    already excludes. `page_verify` prints **zero** bytes in fast
    (`println!` compiles out; verified in the trial serials, not
    inferred from source). The console-byte hypothesis therefore
    **cannot** explain the −51.9 µs fast-pair `page_verify` move.
  - **But the mechanism is real and measured, on the safe pair.**
    Per-phase lane delta over known in-window byte counts:
    `page_verify` −5.47 ms / 4,250 B = **−1.29 µs/B**; `virtq_init`
    −2.93 / 2,049 = −1.43; `task_init` ≈ −1.34; the net segment
    ≈ −1.27; `stvec` −3.58 µs/B is the outlier exactly because it
    also carries the DBCN-probe seam. A consistent **δ ≈ −1.3 µs
    per byte** (DBCN dearer than the polled UART) across ~9.2 KB of
    independent segments. Generalisation: ~13.1 KB × δ 1.27 µs/B
    (DBCN 3.69 − polled UART 2.42, both measured absolutes) ≈
    **−17 ms of the safe-pair E2→E3g delta is console-lane
    artifact**, which
    hardens the existing rule from "safe rows are lane-internal" to
    *per-phase cross-lane comparison is contaminated for every
    printing phase, at a measured rate* (δ = 1.27 µs/B, the
    difference of two absolutes: DBCN 3.69, polled UART 2.42 —
    reconciled below).
  - **Exclusion criterion upgraded as proposed** — a phase is seam
    iff it *has a seam call site OR emits in-window console bytes*,
    both statable from source with no delta in hand. Applied by
    grep for the fast comparator: `println_always` sites reachable
    pre-response are the panic path (never on a clean run) and the
    app's `HTTP READY` (inside `E3g`). **The fast exclusion set is
    unchanged: {`stvec`, `frame_init`, `E3g`}** — now justified by
    the stronger criterion.
  - **The anomaly stands unexplained.** With console ruled out by
    direct count, the layout/TB hypothesis for `page_verify` −51.9
    µs is *unproven, not confirmed by elimination*. The direct test,
    proposed and not run: a same-binary 2×2 — the `bios-none`
    kernel should boot under OpenSBI too (polled UART and
    sifive_test work there; `stimecmp` needs OpenSBI's
    `menvcfg.STCE`, a five-minute check), giving (m-binary, OpenSBI)
    vs (m-binary, shim) = pure lane effect, and (m-binary, OpenSBI)
    vs (SBI-binary, OpenSBI) = pure binary effect, ~20 boots per
    cell. Threshold **not pinned**; the choice — run the 2×2, or
    adopt two-tier 150 µs with the anomaly disclosed as
    unexplained — is left to sign-off.
  - **Nothing published depends on a cross-lane per-phase comparison
    of a printing phase**: no cross-lane number is published at all
    (t47 is not a publication basis; every exhibit is
    OpenSBI-only), and the recorded falsifier-2 analysis excluded
    `E3g`, the one printing fast phase.
- **Correction to the campaign-outcome block above (2026-08-19):
  "stability PASS on all four arms" was a misreport** from a
  truncated read of the verdict list. Re-running summarize over the
  now-committed CSVs: three arms and the fast pair's E2→E3g PASS,
  but **`release-fast-boot` FAILS batch-to-batch stability** —
  E0→E4 52.596 vs 55.427 ms (Δ 2.83, tol 1.11), `w_ns` +2.79 ms —
  while `m-release-fast-boot` is flat. The movement sits in the
  OpenSBI E0-side window and not in guest work, so: the falsifier-2
  comparator is unaffected; t47's pooled ΔE0→E4 and ΔS are
  **regime-mixed across batches** (one more reason t47 is not a
  publication basis); and this bears on the OpenSBI-banner open
  observation — a ~2.8 ms same-shape move between two batches an
  hour apart, banner-carrying arm only — where it is recorded and
  deliberately not resolved.
- **Misread scoped (2026-08-19): the truncation touched t47 only.**
  Full per-arm stability re-run from every pinned campaign with a
  corrected complete reader: **t48b 5/5 arms PASS**, T4.8 5/5, T4.3
  baseline 2/2, T4.6 after-ladder 2/2 — values and tolerances
  checked, no summary trusted. The tool was fail-closed throughout
  (nonzero exit, `TEST FAIL` with detail); the failure was a reader
  filtering its output. The reader trap was real, though: a failing
  arm got **no verdict token in the stability section itself** —
  PASS lines went to the section, failures to stderr at the end, so
  the section alone read complete while short. Fixed in `bench.py`
  (commit `6f775a5`, whose message described this record a commit
  early): every arm now gets an explicit PASS/FAIL line in the
  section plus a `stability: N/M arms PASS` totals line.
- **The 2×2 (2026-08-19): the lane carries the anomaly, not the
  binary.** Pre-check: the `bios-none` kernel boots to `M3
  UNIKERNEL OK` under OpenSBI (so OpenSBI sets `menvcfg.STCE` and
  cell B is well-formed). Three cells, 20 boots each, interleaved
  round-robin in one session:

  | phase | K_SBI@OpenSBI | K_M@OpenSBI | K_M@shim | binary (B−A) | lane (C−B) |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | page_verify | 718.7 | 730.5 | 674.6 | **+11.8 µs** | **−56.0 µs** |
  | stvec | 255.2 | 31.9 | 31.9 | −223.3 (seam) | +0.1 |
  | frame_init | 138.1 | 76.7 | 62.5 | −61.4 (seam) | −14.2 |
  | task_init | 579.5 | 584.9 | 595.2 | +5.3 | +10.4 |
  | virtq_init | 832.0 | 847.8 | 834.5 | +15.8 | −13.3 |

  Same binary, different resident M-mode environment: −56 µs on a
  phase that prints nothing and calls nothing. The seam-site
  attribution is independently confirmed (stvec's −223 is pure
  binary, zero lane). The finding, in status order:
  - **Measured:** an ambient lane systematic, ≤ 56 µs per phase,
    concentrated on memory-walk-heavy phases and ~0 on tight loops.
  - **Candidate mechanism, hypothesis only:** PMP region count
    under TCG TLB fill — OpenSBI programs ~8 PMP regions, the shim
    one NAPOT catch-all, and TCG consults PMP on every TLB fill,
    which would tax page-table-walking phases most. **Confirming
    cell named and not run:** a shim variant programming eight
    regions, ~20 boots against the one-entry shim.
  - **The graveyard, kept visible:** this is the *third* mechanism
    proposed for `page_verify` — console bytes (refuted by direct
    count: zero in-window bytes in fast), layout/TB (refuted by
    this 2×2: binary term +11.8 µs), now PMP geometry. The third
    carries the same status the first two had until its cell runs;
    it does not inherit confidence from being last. What it has
    that they lacked: it survived the tests that killed them, and
    its predicted concentration on memory-walk phases matches the
    measured profile.
  - **This sits under a publication-path number.** The 150 µs
    falsifier-2 floor is set by this systematic while it remains
    unexplained. If the variant ever needs a tighter leak bound,
    **running the eight-region cell is the unblocking move**: a
    confirmed mechanism turns the floor from "unexplained ambient"
    into a modelled term that could be subtracted or shimmed away.
  Whatever the mechanism, it is a property of the resident M-mode
  configuration — part of what swapping the firmware *is* — but it
  is ambient, not call-site-localisable, so the seam-call-site
  criterion cannot absorb it and the threshold must clear it as a
  floor.
- **δ reconciled (2026-08-19).** The polled store is not near-free:
  absolute rates from the safe pair's `page_verify` segment, this
  regime — DBCN (16.419 − 0.731 ms)/4250 B = **3.69 µs/B**; polled
  UART (10.947 − 0.679)/4250 = **2.42 µs/B**; δ = 1.27, matching
  the four-segment slope. **δ is the difference of two measured
  absolutes, not a slope** — the slope alone invited the "near-free
  polled store" assumption, wrong by the whole 2.42 µs/B. Two MMIO
  exits per byte (LSR poll + THR store) under TCG is µs-scale each.
  D-0078's "~1.0 µs/B" is the *regime step* on the DBCN path, a
  different quantity — the two numbers are not in contradiction; the
  canary's 16.07 ms `page_verify` is the absolute DBCN rate at the
  same bytes. No second term; the ~13.1 KB × 1.3 ≈ −17 ms
  contamination figure stands with both absolutes recorded.
- **PRE-REGISTRATION — T4.7 confirmation campaign (adopted
  2026-08-19, signed off; governs the next `just bench-t47` run).**
  Written for a bench-host operator with no context beyond the repo.
  This block supersedes the earlier per-phase falsifier 2 for the
  confirmation run only; t47 (batches `20260819T164056Z-1/-2`)
  stays as recorded — the run whose original falsifier fired and
  from which nothing is published.
  - **Launch.** From a clean tree with HEAD == origin (the harness
    enforces both), on the dedicated bench host:
    `setsid nohup just bench-t47 </dev/null > ~/t47-confirm.log 2>&1 &`
    One invocation = one batch set. Four whimbrel arms, interleaved
    in one shuffle: `release-fast-boot`, `release-default` (OpenSBI
    lane) and `m-release-fast-boot`, `m-release-default` (shim
    lane, booted via the extracted blob in QEMU's `-bios` slot).
    3 warmup + 30 recorded per arm per batch, two shuffled batches.
    The harness runs one canary boot before trial 1 and records its
    two deltas on **every** `runs.csv` row
    (`canary_stvec_ns`, `canary_page_verify_ns`); the shim blob's
    sha256 lands in every shim row's `bios_sha256`. If the canary
    yields no PHASE dump the campaign aborts before trial 1.
  - **Claims (design (d)).**
    Claim A: **ΔE2→E3g, pooled, stability-gated** — guest work, the
    primary claim.
    Claim B: **ΔE0→E4, reported per batch**, with the OpenSBI-side
    volatility disclosed as a property of the quantity being
    removed (the firmware window has moved ±3 ms on an hour
    timescale on this host; per-trial `w_ns` records it).
    **Registered now, before the run:** a batch-to-batch stability
    failure that is confined to the OpenSBI fast arm's E0-side
    metrics (`e0_to_e4_ns`, `w_ns`) does **not** abort the
    campaign; it demotes claim B from pooled to per-batch. Every
    other stability failure — any guest-work metric, any other
    arm — aborts as always. This demotion rule is registered before
    the run, not chosen after seeing one.
  - **Falsifier 2 (rescoped, two-tier, 150 µs).** Exclusion
    criterion first, set second. *Criterion:* a phase is a **seam
    phase** iff, by source inspection with no delta in hand, its
    interval (a) contains a call site of a replaced-SBI seam
    (DBCN/BASE probe, TIME probe, `set_timer`→`stimecmp` arm) or
    (b) emits in-window console bytes in the compared profile.
    *Set, derived by grep for the fast comparator:*
    **{`stvec`, `frame_init`, `E3g`}** (the only fast in-window
    print, `HTTP READY`, lands inside `E3g`). *The falsifier:* on
    the fast pair (`m-release-fast-boot` − `release-fast-boot`,
    per-phase Δ of recorded medians), fire if either tier trips:
    the **per-phase tier** — any non-seam phase has |Δ| >
    **150 µs** — or the **sum tier** — |Σ of signed Δ over all
    non-seam phases| > **150 µs**.
    *Floor derivation:* measured ambient lane systematic ≤ 56 µs
    per phase (2×2, same binary across lanes), non-seam binary term
    ≤ 16 µs, batch-split noise ≤ 8.1 µs, measured signed sum
    +11 µs; 150 is ~3× the worst measured ambient. *Stated
    limitation:* a single-phase leak between ~56 and 150 µs is
    below this instrument's floor; the floor is set by a measured
    but mechanism-unconfirmed ambient (see the PMP hypothesis
    above), and the aggregate E2→E3g delta is reported as its own
    term regardless, so a sub-floor leak biases a disclosed number,
    not a hidden one.
  - **Expected ΔE2→E3g (fast pair, shim − OpenSBI): a range, not a
    point — [−1.1, −0.4] ms** (brackets t47's same-day −0.717 and
    the cross-day −0.40; D-0069). Outside the range: investigate
    before publishing; it is an expectation, not a falsifier.
  - **ΔS window unchanged.** ΔS = S(OpenSBI fast) − S(shim fast),
    from the batch header's lane-separated S lines; expected in
    **(+0.1, +1.5) ms** (the removed `fw_dynamic` load). Falsifier:
    ΔS < −0.3 ms or |ΔS| > 3 ms. S is never pooled across lanes;
    the shim-safe arm's S is a known open anomaly with no consumer
    and does not gate anything.
  - **Falsifier 1 (amended — baseline moved, disclosed).**
    `m-release-fast-boot` E0→E4 median ≥ the same batch's
    `release-fast-boot` median — no improvement; stop, publish
    nothing. *Amendment:* the original baseline was t48b's fixed
    51.87 ms; it is now the same batch's OpenSBI fast median,
    because the banner volatility makes a fixed cross-campaign
    number the wrong comparator under design (d) and D-0078's
    no-cross-campaign-pooling rule. The change is directionally
    **looser** when the banner runs inflated (t47's OpenSBI fast
    read 54.27 ms against t48b's 51.87) — immaterial at the
    observed ~26 ms margin, but disclosed rather than absorbed.
  - **Falsifiers 3, 4, 5, 6 (unchanged).**
    Falsifier 3: **Any M-mode trap in any serial of any trial or
    gate — the shim's `M!` diagnostic line — is the falsifier, not
    a bug to fix.** Stop.
    Falsifier 4: Any `just test-m` gate that passes on
    `-bios default` and fails under the variant. Stop.
    Falsifier 5: The published `-bios default` rows (the t48b
    exhibit pins) move at all. The variant is additive; stop.
    Falsifier 6: Saving < 2× the largest remaining S-mode rung
    (2 × `virtq_init` 0.84 ms ≈ 1.7 ms) — D-0061 abandon criterion
    (b); abandon and write up the partial result.
  - **Report back, in this shape:** the `summary.txt` header
    verbatim (canary line, lane-separated S lines, stability
    section with its per-arm PASS/FAIL lines and `N/M arms PASS`
    total); per-arm, per-batch E0→E4 and E2→E3g medians with IQRs;
    per-batch ΔE0→E4 for the fast pair and pooled ΔE2→E3g; the
    non-seam per-phase Δ table against the 150 µs bounds, both
    tiers; ΔS with the window verdict; each falsifier's verdict on
    its own line; `results/gate-failures.csv` contents or its
    absence; and the CSVs committed. **No exhibit and no report
    edits until the numbers have been reviewed** — the exhibit's
    same-campaign gate (both lanes from one batch set, canary
    columns present in the pinned CSV) binds when it is built.
- **Confirmation campaign (2026-08-19, batches
  `20260819T201001Z-1/-2`): ABORTED by the stability gate, as
  registered.** `dirty=0`, `git_sha=9dfbcd8`, steal 0 on all 240
  recorded trials, canary columns present, no gate-failure rows from
  this run. Stability 3/4: `release-default`
  `e0_to_first_connect_ns` median 18,987,600 vs 18,508,166 ns
  (Δ = 479,434, tol = 379,752). The metric is not `e0_to_e4_ns` or
  `w_ns` and the arm is not the OpenSBI fast arm, so the demotion
  rule does not apply and the registration aborts. Nothing
  publishes from this run; the numbers are recorded below because
  the rescope was adopted precisely to be tested.
  - **Per-arm, per-batch medians (IQR), ms:**

    | arm | b1 E0→E4 | b2 E0→E4 | b1 E2→E3g | b2 E2→E3g |
    |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
    | release-fast-boot | 52.20 (0.64) | 52.13 (0.32) | 6.406 (0.051) | 6.393 (0.052) |
    | release-default | 139.67 (1.10) | 139.41 (0.87) | 90.816 (0.506) | 90.799 (0.829) |
    | m-release-fast-boot | 28.56 (0.54) | 28.39 (0.23) | 5.738 (0.152) | 5.656 (0.076) |
    | m-release-default | 96.70 (0.76) | 96.42 (0.40) | 73.597 (0.306) | 73.525 (0.265) |

  - Per-batch fast-pair ΔE0→E4 (shim − OpenSBI): **−23.65 ms**
    (b1) and **−23.74 ms** (b2) — batch-consistent to 90 µs.
    Pooled fast-pair ΔE2→E3g: **−0.729 ms**, inside the expected
    range [−1.1, −0.4].
  - **Falsifier 2 under the rescope — the question the rescope was
    adopted to answer: it would NOT have fired.** Per-phase tier:
    worst non-seam |Δ| = **61.1 µs** (`page_verify` — consistent
    with the measured ≤ 56 µs ambient plus noise; next largest
    17.6 µs, `net_init_done`). Sum tier: Σ signed non-seam Δ =
    **+13.4 µs**. Both tiers PASS with ~2.5× and ~11× headroom.
    Seam phases for reference: `stvec` −222.4, `frame_init` −75.0,
    `E3g` −511.7 µs — reproducing t47 to within 13 µs each.
  - **Falsifier verdicts, one per line:**
    Falsifier 1: PASS (28.56 < 52.20 in b1; 28.39 < 52.13 in b2).
    Falsifier 2 (rescoped): PASS, both tiers (above).
    Falsifier 3: PASS (no `M!` line in any serial; operator-reported
    and spot-checked).
    Falsifier 4: not exercised by a campaign run (gates last run at
    the seam commit; no regression signal).
    Falsifier 5: PASS (t48b exhibit pins untouched).
    Falsifier 6: PASS (saving ≈ 23.7 ms ≫ 1.7 ms).
    ΔS falsifier: PASS (ΔS = **+0.049 ms**; bounds are < −0.3 or
    > 3). **Expectation missed low**: +0.049 sits under the
    expected (+0.1, +1.5) window — recorded, not explained; the
    window was the fw-load model and the miss is 51 µs.
    Stability gate: **FAIL 3/4** (the abort; diagnosis below).
  - **Disposition (user, 2026-08-19): abort sustained.** The
    registration says abort; the diagnosis does not change that,
    and re-reading a gate to pass after it fires is the move this
    project does not make. **t47b joins t47 as
    recorded-not-published.**
  - **The ΔS expectation miss is explicable by the same drift:** ΔS
    is a between-arm E0-side difference, and the characterized
    minutes-scale startup drift imposes ±100–300 µs of
    time-placement sampling residual on exactly such differences
    (the first-connect residual scale); a 51 µs shortfall sits well
    inside it. One line, not an open item.
- **Diagnosis of the aborting metric: a common host-side drift, not
  arm content.** Per-arm batch-to-batch moves in
  `e0_to_first_connect_ns` (all µs): fast −200.5, **default
  −479.4 (FAIL)**, m-fast −96.3, m-default −267.1 — all four arms
  moved the same direction, every IQR shrank in batch 2, and the
  campaign spanned only ~3.4 minutes. Pooled time-decile medians
  fall from ~19.0 ms (first decile) to ~18.49 ms (last) with
  mid-campaign bumps — minutes-scale drift in host-side QEMU
  startup latency (listener-up precedes the guest; D-0070). A
  time-local predictor absorbs most of the failing arm's move
  (residuals +109/−78 µs, inside the ±29…±287 µs residual scatter
  of the *passing* arms), and a lag-1 test shows no cross-lane
  contamination (first-connect by previous trial's lane: 18,657 vs
  18,660 µs). Conclusion: the single-arm FAIL is common drift
  against a 2 % tolerance (~380 µs) at the edge, with shuffle
  sampling deciding which arm crossed it — not content in
  `release-default`. The cheap test not run: ~50 back-to-back bare
  QEMU spawns recording only listener-up, nothing else varying,
  which separates campaign-workload-induced drift from ambient
  host state. The ≤ 1 ms cross-arm span control holds in both
  batches (338.4 and 127.1 µs).
  - **The E0 anchor is adequate for claim B, by direct
    measurement:** claim B is a same-batch between-arm difference,
    and the two batches' fast-pair ΔE0→E4 agree to **90 µs**
    (−23.65 vs −23.74 ms) while the common E0-side level moved
    ~0.5 ms — the difference cancels the drift, which is what the
    per-batch design was for.
- **The canary and the campaign disagree — D-0078's residual risk
  observed in its worst form.** The canary read **1.039 / 12.070
  ms** (deflated, T4.8-regime). The safe arm's own per-trial
  deltas — the in-campaign monitor D-0078 named — show **every one
  of its 60 trials ran inflated** (`page_verify` 15.85–16.51 ms,
  median 16.14, uniform; `stvec` 1.178). The regime flipped in the
  seconds between the canary boot and trial 1 and stayed flipped.
  Consequences, recorded not fixed: the start-of-campaign canary is
  necessary but **not sufficient** exactly as D-0078 stated, and
  the authoritative regime record for any campaign is the safe
  arm's own per-trial deltas; any cross-campaign safe-profile
  comparison must key on that witness, never on the canary alone.
  By the witness, **this campaign ran inflated**. Refinement from
  the warmup rows: the first safe warmup read 11.85 ms — deflated,
  agreeing with the canary — and the second 16.28; the canary was
  correct at its instant, the flip landed inside the warmup window,
  and the failure is in reading one instant as a certificate (the
  D-0078 amendment drafted from this). **REFUTED 2026-08-20 (t47c
  review): the refinement above kept the wrong boot order.**
  11.85 ms was **batch-2's** first warmup, mid-campaign; batch 1's
  warmups — seconds after the canary — read 16.28/16.32/16.21,
  inflated. There was no flip inside the warmup window and the
  canary was not correct at its instant; the deflated reading sits
  at the same structural position (each batch's first safe warmup)
  in all four pinned campaigns. Evidence table and the re-draft:
  the D-0078 amendment refutation block; grain-rule instance 7.
- **Banner open observation, third point — and the witness corrects
  its premise.** By the in-campaign witness all three campaigns are
  the **same DBCN regime (inflated)**: t48b fast E0→E4 51.87, t47
  54.27, this run 52.20/52.13 — a 2.4 ms spread *within* one
  serial regime, plus t47's own 2.83 ms batch split. If the serial
  regime drove the OpenSBI-window variance, same-regime campaigns
  should agree; they do not, and the one cross-check available
  (m-safe `page_verify`, the UART path: 10.95 → 10.79 ms across
  campaigns) barely moves. The OpenSBI startup window varies on a
  host state that is **not** the DBCN serial regime. Still an
  observation, deliberately unresolved.
- **Stale `gate-failures.csv` — misattribution hazard, fix proposed
  and not implemented.** The file on disk predates this campaign
  (12:19, t47's aborted first attempt) and a reader asking "did
  this campaign have gate failures" can pick up another campaign's
  rows. Every row already carries `batch_id`, so the honest reading
  rule exists; the proposals: (a) the harness rotates the file into
  the finished campaign's `trials/<batch>/` directory at campaign
  start, so `results/gate-failures.csv` only ever holds the
  current run's rows; (b) readers filter by the current batch set.
  Recommended: both — (a) as the mechanism, (b) as the rule the
  report shape states. Neither is implemented here.
- **Second consecutive campaign in which a pre-registered gate
  fired and the diagnosis was a mis-specified null — recorded
  before a third, not after.** t47: falsifier 2 fired; diagnosis:
  the null assumed seam swaps were cost-neutral; rescoped, and this
  campaign's data confirms the rescope measured the right thing
  (both tiers pass with the seam phases reproducing t47 within
  13 µs). This campaign: the stability gate fired on a pre-guest
  metric; diagnosis: the null assumes batch equivalence that
  minutes-scale host drift violates at a 2 % tolerance on a ~19 ms
  quantity. Both diagnoses may be right — each is backed by a
  per-trial join, and the second by four arms moving together. But
  the pattern is now two-for-two, and a third instance should be
  read as evidence about **how the gates' nulls are written** —
  against an idealized stationary host this project has now
  measured, repeatedly, not to have — rather than about the
  individual gates. Disposition of this campaign's abort is the
  user's; nothing here proposes weakening anything.
- **Second attempt authorized (2026-08-20; registered before
  launch).** The confirmation campaign re-runs under the
  pre-registration block above, **unchanged**, with three
  pre-commitments and a minimal enforcement delta:
  - **Pre-commitment 1 — unchanged registration.** The adopted
    block governs verbatim; the t47b abort history is disclosed in
    the campaign record.
  - **Pre-commitment 2 — rerun cap.** This is the second attempt
    (t47b was the first). If it aborts again on a pre-guest
    control, there is no third roll: the D-0080 probe converts from
    improvement work back to blocker, and the abort pair becomes
    the drift evidence. Registered now so that reruns cannot become
    a filter selecting host weather.
  - **Pre-commitment 3 — disclosure.** The campaign record states
    that D-0055's stability null is under methodology review
    (D-0080, open) and that the run proceeded because a pass under
    the current, stricter criterion survives every contemplated
    resolution of that review.
  - **Enforcement delta (the only harness change before launch;
    D-0080's looks-fine-isn't defect class is the reason):**
    (1) falsifier 3 is computed — `falsifier3_scan` checks every
    trial and canary serial for the shim's `M!` diagnostic at parse
    time, fails closed at first hit with a gate-failure row, and
    the summary header reports `falsifier3_mtrap: 0 hits in N
    trial serials + canary`; (2) the 3+30 counts are gates —
    `require_registered_counts` refuses to launch a campaign kind
    with n ≠ 30 or warmup ≠ 3 (both were silently overridable via
    `BENCH_N`/`BENCH_WARMUP`; no override exists), plus a post-hoc
    per-group warmup row-count assert beside the existing
    recorded-count assert. Both gates carry failing-input selftests
    per the D-0055 methodology amendment. Certifying the delta also
    surfaced and fixed `bench-selftest`'s own environment
    assumption (see the D-0080 audit disposition).
  - **Stays prose for this run, listed so the verdicts are known to
    be hand-built:** falsifier 1 (same-batch median comparison),
    falsifier 2 (both 150 µs tiers and the non-seam Δ table; the
    seam set {`stvec`, `frame_init`, `E3g`} is not in code), the
    demotion-rule tagging, the ΔS window and its falsifier,
    falsifier 6's arithmetic. Computing them is follow-up work, not
    launch work.
  - Operational, not registration: schedule in quiet host weather,
    not immediately after large builds.
- **Confirmation campaign, second attempt (2026-08-20, batches
  `20260820T130700Z-1/-2`, git_sha=346f4c1 dirty=0, CSVs committed
  at c2759e2): PASSED — every falsifier verified. T4.7 publishes.**
  - Gate state: stability 4/4 arms PASS; steal 0 on all 240
    recorded trials; counts gated; `falsifier3_mtrap: 0 hits in 264
    trial serials + canary` (computed, fail-closed). **Regime:
    inflated, established by the witness** — all 60 recorded
    safe-arm trials in 15.613–16.535 ms (median 16.180, IQR 0.141),
    uniform across batches (16.249/16.131); the canary read 12.007
    and **disagrees**, the second of two comparable cases — see the
    D-0078 amendment refutation block for what the canary actually
    measures.
  - **Falsifier verdicts** (1, 2, ΔS and 6 hand-built, prose-only
    as registered):
    - Falsifier 1 PASS per batch: m-fast 28.579 < fast 52.270
      (batch 1); 28.501 < 52.190 (batch 2).
    - Falsifier 2 PASS both tiers (seam set {`stvec`, `frame_init`,
      `E3g`} by the registered criterion): worst non-seam |Δ| =
      57.0 µs (`page_verify` — reproduces t47's −56 µs ambient lane
      systematic; PMP-geometry hypothesis unchanged, its cell still
      unrun); Σ signed non-seam = +31.3 µs. Bounds 150/150.
    - ΔS = −0.002 ms: both falsifiers PASS (not < −0.3, not > 3);
      expectation window MISS, third consecutive — refuted as a
      model below.
    - Falsifier 6 PASS: saving 23.69 ms against the 1.7 ms bar
      (14×).
    - Falsifier 3 PASS, **computed this run** (harness gate as of
      346f4c1); the prior campaigns' retroactive verification is in
      the D-0080 record.
    - Falsifier 4 PASS: `just test-m` re-run at 346f4c1 after the
      campaign, all gates green — a same-day verdict, not a carried
      one.
    - Falsifier 5 PASS by construction: the t48b exhibit pins are
      immutable git objects; nothing republished.
  - **Claims (design (d)). Claim A**, pooled ΔE2→E3g, stability-
    gated: **−0.714 ms** (fast 6.402, IQR 0.057; m-fast 5.688, IQR
    0.098; per batch −0.718/−0.703; inside the registered
    [−1.1, −0.4]; t47 read −0.717 — reproduction to 3 µs across a
    day). **Claim B**, ΔE0→E4 per batch: **−23.691 (batch 1),
    −23.689 (batch 2) ms** — the two batches agree to 2 µs.
    Cross-campaign: m-fast 28.50–28.58 sits inside the prior
    six-batch span [28.39, 28.84]; the OpenSBI side (52.19–52.27)
    sits with t48b (51.87) and t47b (52.13–52.20), t47's 55.43
    remaining the banner outlier; nothing moved beyond the
    campaigns' own spread except what the banner window owns.
  - **S figures, quoted verbatim from the gitignored `summary.txt`
    (S has no CSV column; this is its durable record):**
    `s_ns=7036221 iqr=1275485 n=120`; `s_ns_mshim=5526314
    iqr=2127618 n=120`; `s_ns_fast=6930821 s_ns_safe=7047765`;
    `s_ns_m_fast=6932504 s_ns_m_safe=5274049` — the shim-safe S
    anomaly persists (−1.77 ms, profile-dependent, no consumer).
  - **ΔS expectation refuted as a model (D-0069 pattern: the model
    is wrong, not the runs).** Three campaigns, one direction,
    converging on zero: **+0.161, +0.049, −0.002 ms**. S is the
    post-connect residual — (E0→E4 − E0→first_connect) − (W + SYN
    + D_fin) — and a 0.1–1.5 ms per-boot `fw_dynamic` *load* inside
    that residual is excluded at three campaigns' resolution. The
    load either costs ~nothing per boot (the image is page-cached
    across boots and QEMU maps it once at machine init) or lands
    before the hostfwd listener is up — inside
    `e0_to_first_connect`, which S subtracts. `fw_dynamic`'s
    *runtime* (banner, init) was never in S; it is the firmware
    window Claim B removes. **Corrected expectation, from all three
    measurements rather than a load model: ΔS ≈ 0, |ΔS| ≤ 0.2 ms.**
    The falsifier bounds (ΔS < −0.3 ms, |ΔS| > 3 ms) stand
    unchanged as coarse sanity.
  - **Published claim — the report's sentence, conditions with the
    ratio:** "Under QEMU TCG on the pinned bench host (D-0055
    controls: two interleaved 30-trial batches, stability-gated
    4/4, steal 0), replacing OpenSBI with the 320-byte M-mode shim
    in the `-bios` slot cuts the fast-boot image's
    spawn-to-first-HTTP-byte median from 52.2 ms to 28.5 ms per
    batch (−23.7 ms, 1.8×), of which only −0.71 ms is guest-side
    work (pooled ΔE2→E3g); the remainder is the removed firmware
    window, whose size varies by ±3 ms across campaigns and is
    therefore reported per batch, never pooled."
  - **Deferred, listed so they are not lost — none block
    publication:** the exhibit build with its same-campaign gate;
    the parity split and D-0078 amendment adoptions (including the
    2026-08-20 refutation and carve-out re-draft); the redesigned
    drift probe; the `gate-failures.csv` rotation fix; computing
    falsifiers 1, 2, ΔS and 6; the audit's other prose-only
    registrations.
- **Correction to the t47b and t47c IQR cells (2026-08-24).** The
  per-arm table under the aborted confirmation, and the t47c
  witness and Claim A IQRs, were replaced in place with harness
  `iqr()` (inclusive / type 7). The published copies did not come
  from `scripts/bench.py`. t47b's came from `statistics.quantiles()`
  at its default, which is exclusive / type 6 while the harness is
  inclusive / type 7 — all sixteen cells matched exclusive after
  the table's own rounding, and zero matched the harness. t47c's
  came from a different hand-typed quartile, integer-index
  `s[3n//4] - s[n//4]` (n=60: `s[45] - s[15]`), identified by the
  banker's-rounding fingerprint on 0.1425 → 0.142; exclusive
  formats as 0.103 / 0.155 and inclusive as 0.098 / 0.141, so t47c
  was neither. Replaced: t47b IQR column 0.72/0.34/0.056/0.057,
  1.17/0.95/0.581/0.855, 0.60/0.25/0.155/0.082, 0.82/0.45/0.330/
  0.291 → 0.64/0.32/0.051/0.052, 1.10/0.87/0.506/0.829, 0.54/0.23/
  0.152/0.076, 0.76/0.40/0.306/0.265; t47c witness 0.142 → 0.141,
  Claim A 0.060 / 0.102 → 0.057 / 0.098. Every median in those
  tables was exact to the nanosecond; only dispersion was
  affected. No gate or falsifier uses IQR, so no verdict changed
  and no campaign needed re-running. The live T4.7 exhibit already
  printed harness inclusive from the same pin (`c2759e2`), so only
  the typed copy in this entry was wrong. Nothing structural stops
  this recurring: the generators are gated; a hand-typed number in
  an entry is not. That is why entries quote exhibits.
- **F8 — falsifier 3 on the shim gate path (2026-08-24).** The
  registered wording was "any serial of any trial or gate." The
  computed scan added before t47c covered campaign trial serials
  and the canary only. The only gate that boots the shim is
  `just test-m`, via two `boot-test.sh` invocations with
  `QEMU_BIOS` set to the blob. `boot-test.sh` now calls
  `python3 scripts/bench.py scan-mtrap` after QEMU, only when
  `QEMU_BIOS` is set and not `default`, on every exit path that
  has a log **including 124**. A hit is `TEST FAIL` (falsifier 3),
  not `TEST HANG`. That ordering is the actual catch: `_mshim_mtrap`
  parks in `wfi`, so QEMU never stores to sifive_test and the
  timeout returns 124; a scan that ran only on PASS (including
  `check-serial`) could never see the diagnostic. OpenSBI gates
  are not scanned — they cannot print `M!`. The scanner CLI is
  planted in `bench-selftest` and `just test-mtrap-planted` (file
  fixture, no QEMU). **The gate integration is desk-checked only
  until a trapping shim boot is run on the bench host;** this
  machine has no QEMU. Campaign `run_trial` still reads serial
  after the HTTP client checks, and a parked shim hits the QEMU
  timeout raise before either — not a one-line reorder, not
  changed here.
- Revisit trigger: any falsifier; QEMU moving the `virt` FDT or
  reset address (checkpoint 0 and the `check_dtb` assert both catch
  it loudly); or the seams demanding a change outside D-0061's
  allowlist, which is abandon criterion (a) and ends the variant
  rather than widening it.

## D-0080: E0-side drift — characterize it, then decide what D-0055's stability criterion does

- Date: 2026-08-19 — Status: pre-registered, **not run**. Amended
  2026-08-20 on review, still before any run: rules 1, 2 and 4 (each
  amendment disclosed in place, original kept), plus two disclosed
  analyzer fixes. Grok executes from this entry; nothing below has
  produced data except the Arm-0 pass over already-committed CSVs,
  which is quoted with its numbers.
- **The trap, named first.** The stability gate fired (t47b) and this
  entry examines the criterion it fired against. That is the shape of
  loosening-because-fired, and it would be the third mis-specified-null
  diagnosis in a row (D-0079's meta-item). The discipline: every
  outcome→response pair below is fixed **before** the probe runs, and
  the outcome "the criterion is correct as written and t47b was
  ordinary bad luck" is a live outcome with its response written down:
  **no change, entry closed, abort stands**. If the data lands there,
  that is the result. (2026-08-20: rule 1's first registration of that
  outcome was *itself* a mis-specified null — it ignored that the
  committed campaign record already exceeds the floor the probe would
  be tested against — caught in review before any data ran, the first
  pre-run catch in this sequence. The no-change outcome stays live;
  its detection moved. See rule 1 as amended.)
- **What is being characterized.** `e0_to_first_connect_ns` — host-side
  QEMU startup to hostfwd listener-up, complete before the guest runs
  (D-0070). t47b: all four arms moved the same direction
  batch-to-batch (−96…−479 µs), every IQR shrank, pooled time-deciles
  fell ~19.0 → 18.5 ms across a 3.4-minute campaign; one arm crossed
  the 2 % tolerance (~380 µs) and the registration aborted.
- **Arm 0 — the committed data, already computed (generated from pins,
  no new runs):** per-trial first-connect against `run_order` for the
  three recent campaigns:

  | campaign | dur | sequential half-split Δ | parity split Δ | rank-corr vs time |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | t48b | 5.9 min | +47 µs | −46 µs | +0.11 |
  | t47 | 3.3 min | +150 µs | −100 µs | +0.13 |
  | t47b | 3.3 min | **−304 µs** | **−7.7 µs** | −0.22 |

  Two facts fall out before any probe: the drift **wanders** (its
  direction flips between campaigns run the same afternoon; |ρ| ≤
  0.22), and a **time-orthogonal (parity) split cancels it** — t47b's
  parity delta is 40× smaller than its sequential one. These are
  priors for the projections below, not the verdict; the probe
  characterizes magnitude, timescale, load-dependence and drivers,
  which mined campaigns cannot separate.
- **The design point, judged: the distinction holds, and it is
  statable by property.** Sequential batches make batch 2
  systematically later, so for any quantity with within-campaign
  drift, the gate tests a null — batch temporal equivalence — that
  the design itself violates. The earlier rejection of interleaving
  (t47 campaign design, option (b)) was about the **banner window**,
  where the volatility lives in the measured quantity and smearing it
  across batches would hide a finding. Both positions are instances
  of one rule:

  **A metric gates on sequentially-split batches iff the measured
  system contributes to it — its batch-to-batch variance is evidence
  about the thing being measured. A metric gates on a
  time-orthogonal split iff it completes before (or independent of)
  guest execution — a host-side control whose variance is noise, and
  whose gate exists to test host equivalence.**

  The property is "pre-guest" (D-0070's own classification), not a
  list: `e0_to_first_connect_ns`, `steal`, S are pre-guest controls;
  `e2_to_e3g_ns`, phase deltas, `w_ns`, `e0_to_e4_ns` contain guest
  execution and keep the sequential split. The candidate mechanism is
  **an analysis-time parity split for control metrics only** — batch
  membership for the control gate becomes odd/even `run_order` —
  which changes **no schedule, no batch semantics, and no recorded
  data**: it is a second view of the same trials.
  - **Comparability:** prior campaigns' verdicts stand — they passed
    the *stricter* sequential test on every metric including the
    controls. **t48b needs no re-verdicting: it passed under the
    stricter design; plainly, it is unaffected.** Adoption would
    include a one-time parity-split re-check of the pinned campaigns
    (expectation: all PASS; from Arm 0, t48b −46 µs and t47 −100 µs
    already pass by inspection). **t47b is not re-verdicted**: its
    abort stands under the registration it ran under; its parity
    numbers appear here as design validation only.
- **The probe (Arm A/B), designed and not run.** A ~35-minute block
  session on the bench host, D-0055 controls fail-closed, alternating:
  - **Arm A (ambient):** 25 bare probe spawns per block — campaign
    argv via `scripts/qemu-args.sh`, fast kernel, QEMU pinned cpu6,
    an in-process client on cpu7 polling connect; per spawn record
    spawn→first-successful-connect, then kill. No boot completes; the
    quantity is the campaign metric's analogue (constant offset
    acceptable; drift is the target).
  - **Arm B (under load):** 25 identical probes interleaved with
    campaign-shaped work (one fast-boot trial with curl plus two
    tshark passes over its pcap per few probes) — the campaign's own
    cadence of QEMU exec, page-cache traffic and tshark bursts.
  - **Per block boundary, recorded:** cpuidle `state*/{usage,time}`
    deltas for cpu0/6/7 (recorded, never clamped — D-0078's
    rejection holds), `/proc/meminfo` (Cached, MemAvailable),
    loadavg, one hwmon temperature, wall clock — and **one
    release-default witness boot** whose `page_verify` samples the
    serial regime, so the E0 quantity, the regime quantity and the
    candidate drivers are co-sampled on one timeline.
  - 10 cycles × [sensors, witness, 25×A, sensors, load+25×B] ≈
    30–40 min, ~500 probe points at ~1.5 s resolution.
- **What the design answers / cannot answer.**
  - Monotone vs wander: probe series + Arm 0 (already: wander).
  - Timescale and magnitude: block-to-block and within-block spread
    at seconds-to-minutes scale; session-position vs duration by
    comparing early/late blocks against elapsed time.
  - Ambient vs campaign-induced: Arm A vs Arm B level and trend; a
    systematic A−B offset means the campaign's own load warms the
    path (a warm-up fix, not an interleaving fix); A ≈ B with shared
    wander means ambient host state.
  - Shared driver with the serial regime: block-level correlation of
    first-connect level, witness `page_verify`, and deep-C residency
    — the same-variable hypothesis (cpuidle, D-0078's leading
    untested candidate) predicts both track residency with the same
    sign (busy→shallow→fast serial *and* fast startup, matching
    t48/t48b load medians 0.52/0.18). Correlation discriminates;
    causation would need the clamp this entry does not do.
  - **Cannot answer:** diurnal/wall-clock-of-day dependence (one
    session, one day — stated, not claimed) and thermal/memory
    causation (correlational only).
- **Projections (ranges, D-0069).** Ambient level 18.3–19.3 ms;
  block-to-block wander of block medians 0.1–0.8 ms; within-campaign
  p95 span 0.3–1.0 ms; A−B systematic offset −0.4…+0.1 ms (load
  plausibly warms); monotone-within-session: expected no (Arm 0
  direction flips). Simulated sequential batch-median difference
  under measured drift: p95 in 150–600 µs (i.e. of order the 2 %
  tolerance — capable of producing t47b); parity-split simulated
  p95: under 150 µs.
- **DECISION RULES — fixed 2026-08-19 before the run; rules 1, 2 and
  4 amended 2026-08-20 on review, still before any run.** Analysis
  computes, from the probe series, the simulated distribution of
  batch-median differences for `e0_to_first_connect_ns` under (a)
  sequential and (b) parity assignment at campaign shape (windows of
  60 consecutive probes, n=30 per simulated batch), plus the A−B
  offset, per-arm block-median spans, and the driver correlations.
  Two analyzer disclosures (fixed 2026-08-20, before any run): the
  simulation runs on the **arm-centered pooled series** (each probe
  minus its arm's session median) — uncentered, a static A−B load
  offset masquerades as sequential drift in every window spanning a
  block boundary (selftest now proves the centering removes exactly
  that); and a 60-probe window spans ~4.2 min against the campaign's
  ~3.3, mildly inflating simulated drift exposure — a bias *toward*
  rule 2's precondition, which is why rule 2 now carries an absolute
  parity bound that inflation of the sequential side cannot satisfy.
  1. **As first registered:** sequential-split p95 < 200 µs → the
     criterion is correct as written, t47b was ordinary bad luck, no
     change. **Amended 2026-08-20, before any run: that reading was
     itself a mis-specified null.** The committed campaign record
     already exceeds the floor — t47b's pooled sequential half-split
     is 304 µs and the firing arm's batch-median delta 479 µs — so a
     probe that cannot produce deltas of that scale contradicts the
     record; it does not exonerate the criterion. Three branches,
     each its own outcome (the abort stands under all of them):
     - **1a — the probe is not a valid proxy:** sequential p95 <
       200 µs AND Arm A block-median span < 200 µs AND Arm B span <
       300 µs — no arm shows campaign-scale movement while the
       committed record does. Probe-design failure, not a verdict:
       **nothing is adopted on the probe's authority — not the old
       "criterion correct" reading and not rule 2's parity split** —
       and the next step is reconciling the two instruments, not
       concluding from either. If reconciliation needs a redesign,
       the missing-element candidates are named now: the four-arm
       QEMU/kernel mix, the end-of-arm tshark passes over
       accumulated pcaps, the two-batch rhythm, a different day's
       host weather — and the redesign is pre-registered as an
       amendment here before it runs.
     - **1b — load coupling confirmed (the A-vs-B difference that
       reconciles them):** Arm B block-median span ≥ 300 µs
       (campaign-scale: ≈ t47b's 304 µs pooled half-split, the
       smallest committed exceedance) while Arm A span < 200 µs
       (under the floor). The bare probe was missing the campaign's
       own load: the quantity drifts because of what a campaign does
       to the host, not ambient weather. The loaded condition is the
       proxy of record — campaigns always run loaded — and rules
       2–3 are read on Arm B's evidence.
     - **1c — where the no-change outcome now lives:** sequential
       p95 ≥ 200 µs (the probe *reproduces* campaign-scale drift)
       AND neither rule 2 nor rule 3 finds structure a design change
       would remove. **The criterion is correct as written: the gate
       is refusing to certify batch equivalence on a host that is
       genuinely not equivalent across batches. t47b-scale aborts
       are the gate working. NO CHANGE to D-0055; the response is
       operational (re-run in quieter host weather), not criterial;
       this entry closes.**
  2. **If sequential-split p95 ≥ 200 µs AND parity-split p95 < half
     the sequential p95 AND parity-split p95 < 150 µs absolute
     (amended 2026-08-20: the projection's own parity bound made
     load-bearing, so the disclosed window-span inflation of the
     sequential side cannot fire this rule through the ratio alone)
     AND A ≈ B** (no systematic load offset > 200 µs): the gate's
     null is structurally violated by sequential batches for
     pre-guest controls → **adopt the analysis-time parity split for
     pre-guest control metrics only**, by the property rule above,
     with the one-time pinned-campaign re-check. Measured-quantity
     metrics keep sequential batches. Tolerances move for **no**
     metric. Under 1b this rule reads Arm B's evidence.
  3. **If A−B shows a systematic offset > 200 µs with settling
     shape** (load warms the path): the fix is a **campaign-level
     warm-up window** (pre-registered proposal: discard-by-design a
     fixed initial window, sized from the measured settling time),
     not interleaving; the parity split is not adopted on this
     outcome alone.
  4. **As first registered:** |r| ≥ 0.7 for both first-connect and
     the regime witness against deep-C residency → elevate cpuidle
     residency to a recorded D-0055 host column. **Amended
     2026-08-20 — power stated, rule downgraded to
     hypothesis-generating.** The correlations are Pearson over
     block-boundary pairs: 10 cycles → **n = 9** residency deltas.
     At n = 9, |r| ≥ 0.7 occurs under the null at **≈ 3.6 % per
     test** (analytic p = 0.036; Monte Carlo agrees; the analyzer
     selftest checks this rate). Requiring both tests jointly does
     **not** multiply that to 0.13 %: both share the same residency
     series and the two outcome variables are themselves plausibly
     correlated, so the joint chance rate is only bounded inside
     (0.13 %, 3.6 %). The 95 % CI on an observed r = 0.7 at n = 9
     is **≈ [0.07, 0.93]** — this design cannot distinguish a
     dominant driver from a weak correlate. Power against a true
     ρ = 0.7 is **≈ 0.55**, so a miss excludes nothing either.
     Therefore: **this rule is hypothesis-generating in both
     directions; it can neither establish nor exclude the driver.**
     Firing licenses no driver claim anywhere; its action is
     unchanged — propose cpuidle residency deltas as a recorded
     (never clamped) D-0055 host column — because the column is
     itself the adequately powered follow-up: one campaign yields
     ≥ 60 per-trial pairs per arm, where |r| ≥ 0.6 has a null
     chance ≈ 4×10⁻⁷ and a 95 % CI of ≈ [0.41, 0.74]. **The driver
     claim may be stated only from that follow-up, at |r| ≥ 0.6
     with n ≥ 60, pre-registered when the column lands.** Not
     firing leaves cpuidle exactly where D-0078 left it: leading
     untested candidate. Independent of outcomes 1–3.
  5. **Anything mixed or ambiguous: no change**, publish the
     characterization, and the meta-item's third-instance clause is
     in play — the next step is a review of how gate nulls are
     written, not another tolerance discussion.
  Each adopted response is a harness change that lands only after
  sign-off on the probe's numbers; nothing changes on this entry
  alone.
- **Execution — zero-context operator runbook (self-contained; the
  rest of this entry is background, not prerequisite reading).**
  Preconditions, checked in order; if any fails, **stop and report —
  fix nothing, recreate nothing**:
  1. You are on the Whimbrel bench host. The repo is
     `/home/victor/src/Whimbrel`, branch `m4-evaluation`, clean tree
     (`git status --porcelain` prints nothing), and after
     `git fetch`, `git rev-parse HEAD` equals
     `git rev-parse origin/m4-evaluation`.
  2. The probe instrument is two files kept outside the repo (agent
     scratch rule): `~/whimbrel-diag/e0drift.sh` and
     `~/whimbrel-diag/e0drift.py`. `sha256sum` of each must equal
     the value pinned here — a mismatch means the instrument is not
     the reviewed one:
     - `e0drift.sh` = `2ee3b35256c0e90514925efc34e338b49d37dd15d4ee5e1ee3452d38231248cf`
     - `e0drift.py` = `99422e086d797bc76aa154f6df6d0c71cd970cc3419078979f4c469d0aa8e733`
  3. `python3 ~/whimbrel-diag/e0drift.py selftest` prints a line
     beginning `selftest: PASS`.
  4. Nothing else runs on the host for the next ~40 minutes — no
     builds, campaigns, browsers, or other sessions.
  Launch, from any directory (the env knobs `CYCLES`/`PROBES`/
  `E0_PORT` exist for debugging only and must NOT be set for the
  registered run):
  `setsid nohup bash ~/whimbrel-diag/e0drift.sh </dev/null > ~/e0drift.log 2>&1 &`
  The script independently re-checks this entry's presence, refuses
  a dirty tree, re-runs the analyzer selftest, verifies the D-0055
  host controls before the first spawn **and again after the last**
  (a lapse discards the run), requires an ext4 outdir, and freezes
  `/var/tmp/e0drift/prereg.txt` (git head, script and kernel
  sha256s) before producing any data. Completion: `~/e0drift.log`
  ends with a line beginning `e0drift: done.` after ~35–40 min
  (`probe.csv` ≈ 500 probe rows + 10 witness rows). Then run:
  `python3 ~/whimbrel-diag/e0drift.py report /var/tmp/e0drift`
  and return, verbatim and in full: the report output,
  `~/e0drift.log`, `prereg.txt`, `probe.csv`, `blocks.csv`.
  **Act on nothing.** The verdict lines are inputs to sign-off
  under this entry's decision rules, not instructions. Commit
  nothing — every output lives outside the repo.
- **Standing constraints restated:** no campaign re-run, no harness
  change, no cpuidle clamp, and no adoption of the D-0078 amendment
  are implied by this entry; each follows only from its decision
  rule plus sign-off.
- **First execution, 2026-08-20: INVALID RUN — instrument failure,
  not a host finding. No rule fired or failed legitimately; the
  registration is untested and every analyzer verdict from this run
  is void.**
  - **Provenance (clean):** prereg frozen at `ddf5dd0`, instrument
    sha256s match the pins above, host controls verified in force
    before and after, 509 spawns + 10 witness boots, 0 NA rows,
    witness kernel family `1e654985…`. The run's *execution* was
    exactly as scripted. The script was not the registered design.
  - **The failure:** the registration specified ~500 probes at
    ~1.5 s resolution over ~35–40 min. The instrument had no pacing
    at all and the guest **self-exits after serving** (D-0079's own
    SRST seam — the thing that makes campaign trials fast), so
    witness boots and load bursts take ~270 ms, not their 15 s
    timeouts. Measured from the CSVs: A→A probe cadence 30.7 ms
    median; loadwork slots ~300 ms; whole session **~30 s wall
    clock** (the operator's "07:01:50 to 11:02:20" is a timezone
    misread — the runner logs `date -u`; 11:02:20Z = 07:02:20
    local). The simulated "campaign-shaped" 60-probe windows span
    **3.4–4.7 s** against the campaign's ~200 s — the analyzer's
    printed "≈ 4.2 min" was the registered assumption emitted as
    static text, never computed from timestamps. A probe sampling
    4-second windows is blind by construction to the minutes-scale
    drift that produced t47b; it measured sub-second spawn jitter
    at 1000× the intended frequency.
  - **Why no gate caught it:** the runner fail-closed on entry
    presence, clean tree, selftest, host controls, ext4 — every
    precondition *except its own sampling design*. The registered
    cadence and duration existed only as prose. Two further
    analyzer defects, disclosed: the rule-3 verdict line dropped
    the registered "with settling shape" clause (it over-fired
    relative to the rule as written), and the window-duration claim
    was asserted, not measured.
  - **The selftest was a fail-open gate, and is named as one.** It
    validated the analyzer's arithmetic on synthetic *values* while
    the runner sampled 1000× off its registered cadence — and
    passed, because no input it contains represents the failure
    mode. That is the same shape as the early M4 boot harness
    printing PASS on a stale kernel (audit finding 31): a gate
    satisfiable by the thing it checks. Requirement, standing: the
    selftest must be able to fail on a cadence violation. The input
    that makes it fail: a synthetic probe series with
    realistic values but **timestamps compressed ~100×** (window
    wall-spans ≪ campaign duration) — the analyzer must refuse it
    as void; a correctly paced synthetic series must pass. A
    selftest without both inputs does not gate this instrument.
  - **Consequences for the specific numbers:**
    - Sequential p95 294.4 µs is 4-second-window jitter; its
      near-coincidence with t47b's 304 µs is numerology. The
      comparison the rules run on is void, in both directions.
    - Rule 3's +344.7 µs A−B offset is contention measured
      30–300 ms after load bursts at a duty cycle unlike any
      campaign. Its *sign* (loaded probes slower — contention, not
      warming) contradicts the "load warms the path" mechanism
      rule 3 encoded, and the block table shows **no settling
      shape** (front-6/back-4 step −241 µs across 30 s of wall
      time; cycle 1 is not even the maximum). **No warm-up window
      is drafted: it would discard trials against a transient that
      does not exist, at a timescale that was not measured.**
    - Rule 4's r = −0.79 correlated first-connect against cpu6
      deep-idle time over **3.2 s intervals** during constant QEMU
      spawning, while the host relaxed from the pre-run kernel
      builds (deep-idle fraction 31 % → 47 % across the session as
      first-connect fell). That is micro-contention, trivially
      expected at this grain — not the D-0078 host-state question.
      Not citable, in either direction.
    - The parity cut (294.4 → 105.6) demonstrated that parity
      cancels sub-second jitter, which was never in doubt. The
      probe contributes **nothing** to the parity question; the
      committed-campaign parity priors (Arm 0 table) stand alone
      as one analysis-time observation.
  - **What survives, as hypotheses for the redesigned run only:**
    load slows and destabilizes spawns (A−B +345 µs; Arm B span
    611 µs ≈ 2× Arm A's 347 µs — the campaign-like condition is
    the noisier one); the session's own startup work is a plausible
    within-session trend driver; witness regime this session was
    deflated (page_verify 11.76–12.14 ms), recorded for the regime
    timeline. Predictions, not findings.
  - **Parity disposition (asked and answered):** adopting the
    parity split on rule 3's evidence plus cross-run convergence is
    **not available**. Rule 2 declined it by its registered
    conjunction, this run's parity evidence is void with the rest
    of the run, and taking the outcome anyway would be the fourth
    mis-specified null — this time mis-specified by us, after
    seeing the data. The redesigned run is where rule 2 can
    legitimately fire; the rules as amended remain in force,
    untested, with one text correction owed: the automated rule-3
    line must carry its settling clause.
  - **Residency column (asked and answered):** the case for landing
    per-trial cpuidle residency as a **recorded, never-clamped**
    D-0055 column with the next campaign is sound and does **not**
    rest on this run's r = −0.79, which must not be cited. It rests
    on: D-0078's standing want for discriminating evidence, rule
    4's registered action path, near-zero cost, and the column
    being the only route to the powered n ≥ 60 test. Draft
    registration (lands only with sign-off, as a harness change,
    with the next campaign): sample cpu6 cpuidle `state*/
    {usage,time}` immediately before each trial; per-trial deltas
    as runs.csv columns; driver test **|r| ≥ 0.6, n ≥ 60 per arm,
    two-sided**, pre-registered before that campaign runs; the
    sign is recorded in advance as **unpredicted** (this run's
    negative sign is an observation at an invalid grain).
  - **Verdict-line audit (every rule's implementation checked
    against its registered wording):** rules 1a, 1b match exactly;
    rule 2 matches all four conjuncts including the amended 150 µs
    absolute bound (boundary convention differs immaterially:
    registered "offset > 200 µs" disqualifies, the code uses ≥ —
    measure zero, noted); rule 4 matches the amended
    hypothesis-generating wording and prints its n; rule 5's line
    is prose-accurate. Two defects: **rule 3** (known — settling
    clause dropped, over-fires on offset alone) and **rule 1c,
    found by this audit — it inherits rule 3's defect** through its
    `not rule-3` term. On a *valid* run with offset ≥ 200 µs and no
    settling shape, registered rule 3 would not fire but the
    automated line would, and rule 1c — the no-change outcome —
    would be wrongly suppressed: the defect pair converts
    "criterion correct as written" into "warm-up proposal." Exactly
    this run's shape, so the defect was live, not theoretical. Both
    corrected in the redesign below.
  - **Registration-parameter audit (the D-0055 methodology rule's
    first application; listed, deliberately not fixed).** Live
    registrations, each stated quantitative parameter classified
    ENFORCED (fail-closed in code) / DEFAULT (right value by
    default, silently overridable, nothing ties the invocation to
    the registration) / PROSE (hand-computed or unchecked):
    - **D-0055 standing protocol:** stability tolerance ENFORCED
      (`stability_tol_ns`); host controls ENFORCED; two-batch
      interleaved shuffle and median/IQR ENFORCED structurally;
      **3 + 30 trial counts DEFAULT** — `--n` defaults from the
      `BENCH_N` environment variable, so a stray env var produces a
      nonconforming campaign with normal-looking CSVs (trial
      numbers would betray it on inspection; no gate checks it).
    - **D-0078 standing step:** canary pre-batch boot and
      abort-on-no-PHASE ENFORCED; canary columns ENFORCED;
      regime/witness classification analysis-time by design
      (amendment drafted, not adopted — as registered).
    - **D-0079 confirmation block:** canary abort ENFORCED;
      same-day interleaving ENFORCED structurally (one invocation =
      one shuffle = both batches); per-arm stability verdicts
      ENFORCED. **Falsifier 1 PROSE** (same-batch median
      comparison, hand-computed from the summary). **Falsifier 2
      PROSE, both tiers** — the 150 µs per-phase and sum tests and
      the non-seam Δ table are hand-built each time (t47b's table
      was ad-hoc analysis); the seam set {`stvec`, `frame_init`,
      `E3g`} exists nowhere in code. **Falsifier 3 UNENFORCED** —
      no scan for the shim's `M!` diagnostic anywhere in
      `bench.py`, although `serial_text` is already in memory per
      trial at parse time; a mid-campaign M-mode trap is caught
      only if a human reads 240 serials. **Demotion rule: inputs
      computed, application PROSE** — nothing tags a stability
      failure as demotion-eligible (metric ∈ {`e0_to_e4_ns`,
      `w_ns`} ∧ arm = OpenSBI fast); acceptable as a sign-off
      decision, but the summary could tag it. **ΔS window and its
      falsifier PROSE** (lane S lines printed; comparison by
      hand). **Falsifier 6 arithmetic PROSE.** Falsifier 5
      ENFORCED where it binds (exhibit pin checks); falsifier 4's
      gate exists, the run-both-comparisons step is operator
      prose. The expected ΔE2→E3g range is a declared expectation,
      hand-checked — conformant as registered, listed for
      completeness.
    - **D-0080 itself:** cadence and duration were PROSE (this
      incident); window span was static text; the redesign converts
      all three to enforced or computed-and-gated; the settling
      clause is explicitly non-automated and says so.
    - Same-day disposition: falsifier 3 and the 3+30 counts were
      converted to computed gates before the second confirmation
      attempt (D-0079, second-attempt addendum); the rest remain
      prose and the campaign record says so. Certifying that delta
      surfaced one more instance of the class: `bench-selftest`
      itself assumed Linux artifacts absent ("runs anywhere") and
      has been failing on the bench host since `linux-build` landed
      them — an environment-dependent gate assumption, fixed to
      assert the correct fail-closed shape per environment (green
      boot-test with artifacts present, missing-artifact failure
      without).
    - **REFUTED 2026-08-21 (harness audit, fix 2).** "two-batch
      interleaved shuffle and median/IQR ENFORCED structurally"
      (D-0055 standing protocol above) and "same-day interleaving
      ENFORCED structurally (one invocation = one shuffle = both
      batches)" (D-0079 confirmation block above) stand as written
      — that was the audit's verdict. The batch *count* was not
      structural: `--batches` defaulted from `BENCH_BATCHES` the
      same way `--n` did from `BENCH_N`, and `cmd_run` passed
      `stability=batches >= 2`, so `batches=1` skipped the
      two-batch comparison and still printed TEST PASS. Same
      DEFAULT class as the 3+30 counts this audit already named.
      Converted with the rest of the enforcement pass:
      `require_registered_counts` now gates `batches=2` for
      campaign kinds, and those kinds always request the stability
      comparison.
  - **Falsifier 3's reported verdicts were assertions, not checks —
    said plainly.** Falsifier 3 was restated in every launch prompt
    as the most serious falsifier, and both t47 and t47b were
    reported back as "no M-mode trap in any serial." No scan
    existed and nobody read 265 serials per campaign: those
    verdicts were derived from the absence of failure symptoms (an
    `M!` trap parks the shim, so its trial would very likely have
    failed loudly) — a plausibility argument, not a check. **As
    reported, both campaigns' falsifier-3 verdicts were unverified,
    not passed.** Retroactive scan (2026-08-20): `grep 'M!'` over
    every retained serial — t47: **265 files, 0 hits**; t47b:
    **265 files, 0 hits** (132 serials × 2 batches + canary each,
    all four arms present, counts verified). Both campaigns'
    falsifier-3 verdicts are now **verified PASS on trial and
    canary serials**. Scope stated: the registered falsifier says
    "any trial or gate"; gate-run serials from that day were
    transient and not retained, so the retroactive verdict covers
    what disk holds — every trial and canary serial.
  - **Instrument redesign (drafted, not implemented; adopting it
    changes the scripts, so the sha256 pins above go stale and are
    re-pinned in the amendment that adopts this):**
    1. **Cadence, amended 1.5 → 3.0 s nominal and enforced.**
       Disclosure: at the originally registered 1.5 s the session
       spans only ~4 campaign-lengths; at 3.0 s with unchanged
       counts (10 cycles × 50 probes) it spans ≥ 8. The runner
       sleeps to the next 3.0 s tick; at end of run it **fails
       closed** if the median inter-probe gap falls outside
       [1.5, 4.5] s (the 2× rule) or the achieved session is
       under **25 min**. Both bounds are written into
       `prereg.txt` and checked from the recorded timestamps, not
       from intent.
    2. **Windows become duration-true, not count-true.** A
       simulated campaign window is **200 s of wall clock** (t47/
       t47b length), drawn by start time; sequential split at the
       window's time midpoint, parity by alternation in time
       order; each half subsampled to 30 points to match the
       campaign's batch-median noise. The analyzer **computes**
       achieved window spans from timestamps, prints them, and
       **voids the run** if the median span is under 195 s or any
       window holds fewer than 40 probes.
    3. **Rule 3 prints a conditional, never FIRES on offset
       alone:** "offset condition met; the registered settling
       clause is not automated — the rule-3 verdict requires the
       block-table inspection recorded at sign-off." **Rule 1c
       correspondingly prints pending** until that settling
       verdict exists, closing the inherited defect found by the
       audit above.
    4. **The selftest carries the failure mode** (the fail-open
       item above): compressed-timestamp input must be refused as
       void, correctly paced input must pass; the runner keeps
       refusing to start if the selftest fails.
    5. **Every runner clock prints `date -u` with an explicit
       UTC label**, including the cycle lines and `prereg.txt`.
    **Cost in wall time: ~30 min end to end** — 10 cycles at
    ~2.6 min each (50 paced probes × 3.0 s + witness ~0.3 s +
    5 load bursts ~2 s + sensors) ≈ 26–28 min, plus ~1–2 min of
    kernel builds. Against 30 s for the invalid run, and within
    the 35–40 min originally registered.
  - **Meta-item, new subtype:** the family was "instrument present,
    analysis aggregated past the grain"; this adds "**registration
    stated a design parameter the instrument never implemented,
    and no gate checked it**" — with the corrective rule: every
    registered quantitative design parameter (cadence, duration,
    window span, n) is either enforced at run time or computed
    from the data and gated at analysis time. Never asserted as
    prose, never printed as static text. **Generalized past this
    entry (2026-08-20): the corrective is now a D-0055 methodology
    amendment** — it is a rule about how registrations are
    written, not a drift-probe lesson — with this record as the
    incident pointer and the registration-parameter audit above as
    its first application.
- Revisit trigger: a third consecutive mis-specified-null diagnosis
  anywhere in the gate suite (rule 5's clause); or any future
  campaign aborting on a pre-guest control before this probe has
  run, which converts this entry from scheduled to urgent.

## D-0081: Skip the unaligned-access probe on the Linux cmdline; T4.8c re-run
- Date: 2026-08-21 — Status: accepted (pre-registered 2026-08-21
  before any cmdline edit; T4.8c measured 2026-08-21, published
  2026-08-22; campaign record below)
- **Decision:** append `unaligned_scalar_speed=fast` to both Linux
  kernel cmdlines (the shared quiet append that governs the
  `trimmed` and `stock` rows, and the instrumented append, so the
  observer-cost cell stays pure), re-run the five-arm cross-system
  campaign as **T4.8c**, and publish the corrected ratios with
  T4.8b (`t48b`) kept as the before. No kernel config change, no
  rebuild: every artifact hash in `bench/linux/MANIFEST` must be
  byte-identical before and after.
- **The finding as verified (2026-08-21 Linux-side fairness audit;
  read-only, adversarially verified):**
  - Both `Image-trimmed` and `Image-stock` carry
    `CONFIG_RISCV_PROBE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS=y` (the kconfig default;
    `build/trimmed.config:337`, `build/stock.config:397`).
    `check_unaligned_access_all_cpus` busy-wait-benchmarks
    unaligned access at boot: per test, sync to a jiffy edge then
    a 2-jiffy measure window, twice, at HZ=250 — **~16–24 ms by
    construction, measured 24.0 ms** (initcall table rank 4,
    `results/serial/linux-trimmed-ignore-loglevel-…-initcalls.txt`)
    and **24.1 ms** on the T4.8b image (printk gap ending at
    `Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is 7.36`,
    `linux-trimmed-instrumented-20260819T142033Z-1-t04.log`). The
    wait is jiffies-clocked — wall-fixed, not UART-inflated — and
    runs after timekeeping, before `Run /init`: inside E0→E4 on
    every Linux row. It is counted once in the existing
    decomposition (the initcall entry, the T4.8 gap-rank-5 cell,
    and the T4.8b gap are one interval on three boots) and
    overlaps no other audit item.
  - The probed answer is a foregone conclusion on the pinned
    emulator (measured "fast", ratio 7.36, on the retained logs),
    and no consumer here needs the probe: `/init` never calls
    hwprobe.
  - **Why this was never a D-0073 sweep item, and why the config
    route is closed:** the probe's result has a live consumer on
    the serve path — `has_fast_unaligned_accesses()` in
    `arch/riscv/lib/csum.c` (`do_csum`), consulted for software
    checksums because the shared virtio args force `csum=off` —
    so it fails the sweep rule's "obviously unused" test (D-0073
    criterion b). Structurally it is a kconfig `choice` member: a
    bare unset re-defaults under olddefconfig, so acting by config
    means positively selecting
    `RISCV_EMULATED_UNALIGNED_ACCESS=y`, which encodes knowledge
    of the deployment target. That is the `# CONFIG_SMP is not
    set` class — tuning to the fixed machine shape, disclose-not-
    sweep — and it would also flip the `do_csum` branch. The
    cmdline route sidesteps the config question entirely: the
    pinned 6.18.7 source has
    `__setup("unaligned_scalar_speed=", …)`
    (`arch/riscv/kernel/unaligned_access_speed.c`); `=fast` sets
    the per-cpu speed the probe would have measured and skips the
    probe, leaving runtime behavior identical to today's probed
    outcome. Trap emulation stays built either way; UABI is
    unchanged.
- **Alternatives considered:** flip the kconfig choice to
  `RISCV_EMULATED_UNALIGNED_ACCESS` (rejected: fails D-0073's own
  criteria as written — live `do_csum` consumer; a choice-flip is
  target-knowledge tuning, not an unused-subsystem unset; and it
  changes the checksum branch this workload runs). Leave the probe
  and only disclose it (rejected: D-0073's "Why now" — leaving a
  named ~24 ms sink, the largest single named cost remaining on
  the quiet row, in a row published as "tuned in good faith"
  undercuts the claim, and a zero-config-change removal exists in
  the same tuning envelope as the existing `quiet loglevel=0`
  append). Unset `RISCV_PROBE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS` alone (rejected:
  not a real unset; olddefconfig restores the choice default).
- **Rationale:** the probe measures a property of the machine the
  campaign already pins; its answer is fixed on this emulator; the
  parameter is the same class of cmdline tuning as `loglevel=0`,
  requires no config change and no Image hash change, and both
  Linux rows shed the cost — the change deflates **both**
  published ratios and is therefore against the headline's own
  favor.
- **The change (bench-host operator spec).** Three places carry
  the append and `bench.py` fail-closes if they disagree:
  1. `scripts/bench.py:161-162` — extend `LINUX_APPEND_QUIET` and
     `LINUX_APPEND_INSTRUMENTED` with ` unaligned_scalar_speed=fast`.
  2. `scripts/linux-build.sh:547-548` — the same two strings.
  3. `just linux-build` — regenerates `bench/linux/MANIFEST`'s two
     `append` lines. It must verify-and-reuse: all four `artifact`
     hashes (`Image-stock fa0f4315…`, `Image-trimmed 1bf91509…`,
     `rootfs.cpio 258c9325…`, `init b6cb40b4…`) byte-identical, or
     stop (falsifier 4).
  Then `just test-linux` (boot gate), then the campaign:
  `just bench-t48` on the dedicated bench host under D-0055
  controls (two interleaved batches, 3 warmup + 30 recorded per
  arm, five arms). Report shape: pin the CSVs at a new ref
  (`t48c`), generate a T4.8c cross-system exhibit with a
  before/after table against `t48b` (same shape as
  `cross-system-t48b.md`'s), update the README ratios, and leave
  every `t48b` pin in place as the before.
- **Expected effect (orientation ranges per D-0069, not points):**
  each Linux row's E0→E4 median moves by **Δ ∈ [−27, −16] ms**
  relative to its `t48b` pinned median (mechanism bound 16–24 ms
  plus measurement covariance; the two retained measurements sit
  at 24.0/24.1 ms). Orientation ratios if Whimbrel fast holds
  within ±0.5 ms of 51.87 ms: trimmed ≈ **4.9–5.2×** (from
  5.49×), stock ≈ **17.6–18.1×** (from 18.28×). The ranges are
  orientation; the falsifiers below are the falsifiers.
- **Falsifiers (fail-closed; responses stated before any number
  exists). Per the D-0055 2026-08-20 amendment, checks 1 and 2
  are "stated, unenforced" as of this entry and MUST land as code
  (serial scan in `bench.py check-serial` / summarize-time gate)
  in the same change-set as the append edit, before T4.8c runs:**
  1. **Probe still present.** Any T4.8c instrumented-arm trial
     serial containing `Ratio of byte access time` (or any
     initcall listing containing `check_unaligned_access_all_cpus`
     with nonzero duration) — the parameter did not take. Diagnose
     append propagation (`bench.py:161`, `linux-build.sh:547`,
     MANIFEST, the batch header's `linux_append_quiet=` line)
     before any rerun. No publish.
  2. **Δ out of range.** Either Linux row's E0→E4 median moves
     outside [−27, −16] ms vs `t48b`, in either direction — too
     small means the parameter half-took or the cost was not the
     probe; too large means the change removed more than the named
     mechanism. Diagnose before publishing; do not publish a
     saving.
  3. **Whimbrel moved.** `release-fast-boot` |Δ| > 1 ms vs `t48b`
     (its window has no serial exposure; T4.8→T4.8b moved
     −411 µs). `release-default` is serial-exposed (D-0078): its
     movement is judged against the same-campaign canary, and any
     movement the day's serial regime does not account for fires.
     The Whimbrel arms carry no change; movement is contamination.
  4. **Any artifact hash changed.** The four MANIFEST `artifact`
     hashes must be byte-identical to `t48b`'s. This change must
     not rebuild anything.
  5. **Any gate green in T4.8b failing in T4.8c** — SYN-grid, RST,
     first-connect span ≤ 1 ms, trimmed < stock tripwire,
     stability criterion, READY / `LINUX INIT OK`, host controls.
     Standard responses per D-0062/D-0055.
- **What is NOT claimed.** This is a cmdline tuning choice, not a
  config trim. A deployer who did not know the target's alignment
  behavior would leave the probe in — that is what it is for. The
  parameter encodes the same machine-shape knowledge the campaign
  already pins (and the same class the quiet cmdline already
  encodes); it is listed as tuning, beside `loglevel=0`, in any
  exhibit note. The `stock` row remains config-stock: its config
  is untouched; its cmdline was already tuned and now carries one
  more disclosed tuning token. We still claim *a* minimal Linux,
  not *the* minimal Linux.
- **Campaign record (T4.8c, 2026-08-21).** Batches
  `20260821T233038Z-1` / `20260821T233038Z-2`. Measured kernel
  `1c8816e`, dirty=0, steal 0 on all 300 recorded trials. CSVs
  pinned at tag `t48c` (`fca2f66`). Canary columns unanimous:
  `canary_stvec_ns=1025900` `canary_page_verify_ns=11976600`
  (1.026 / 11.977 ms, deflated). Host controls: virt=none,
  governor=performance, smt=off, boost=0.
  Falsifiers 1 and 2 were registered as "stated, unenforced" and
  landed as code in `1c8816e` (serial scan in `check-serial`,
  summarize-time Δ gate) in the same change-set as the append,
  before this run, with planted failures in `bench.py selftest`.
  That sequencing was this entry's own requirement and it was
  met.
  - **Falsifier verdicts, one per line:**
    Falsifier 1: PASS (probe-absent scan fail-closed per
    instrumented serial; planted ratio-line and nonzero-duration
    initcall failures demonstrated before the run).
    Falsifier 2: PASS (trimmed Δ −20.94 ms, stock Δ −24.40 ms vs
    `t48b`; both inside the pre-registered [−27, −16] ms window).
    Falsifier 3: PASS (`release-fast-boot` Δ +80.8 µs, |Δ| ≪ 1 ms).
    Falsifier 4: PASS (four MANIFEST artifact hashes
    byte-identical to `t48b`; also enforced in `validate_t48c`).
    Falsifier 5: PASS (stability 5/5; steal 0; dirty=0;
    first-connect span 100.3 µs ≤ 1 ms; trimmed 263.75 ms <
    stock 923.70 ms; host controls as pinned; campaign completed
    with the T4.8b boot gates).
  - **Per-batch E0→E4 medians (IQR), ms:**

    | arm | b1 | b2 |
    |---|---:|---:|
    | release-fast-boot | 51.930 (0.231) | 51.975 (0.322) |
    | release-default | 139.314 (0.729) | 139.342 (0.570) |
    | trimmed | 263.484 (0.981) | 264.355 (1.874) |
    | trimmed-instrumented | 286.957 (2.014) | 287.525 (0.944) |
    | stock | 922.629 (2.542) | 924.807 (2.564) |

  - **Before/after vs `t48b` (pooled E0→E4 medians):**
    `release-fast-boot` 51.87 → 51.95 ms (Δ +80.8 µs);
    `release-default` 139.31 → 139.34 ms (Δ +33.3 µs);
    trimmed 284.68 → 263.75 ms (Δ −20.94 ms);
    trimmed-instrumented 310.97 → 287.41 ms (Δ −23.56 ms);
    stock 948.10 → 923.70 ms (Δ −24.40 ms).
  - **Ratios** (T4.8c pooled E0→E4): `release-fast-boot` /
    trimmed = **5.1×**; / stock = **17.8×**. Both sit inside
    the orientation ranges (4.9–5.2 and 17.6–18.1).
  - **Canary boundary.** t48c's canary is 1.026 / 11.977 ms
    (deflated). t48b has no canary columns; its witness is the
    safe-arm phase medians 1.172 / 16.159 ms (inflated). The
    before/after table spans a D-0078 regime boundary. Comparable:
    Whimbrel `release-fast-boot` E0→E4 (zero in-window serial; the
    falsifier-3 control) and the Linux quiet-row deltas (the
    probe is jiffies-clocked, not UART-inflated). Not comparable:
    Whimbrel `release-default` E0→E4 (serial-exposed; canaries
    disagree). The observer-cost cell stays day-scoped.
- **Consequences:** the `stock` row stops being the cross-campaign
  parity control at the T4.8b→T4.8c seam (it moves by design);
  the drift-control role passes to `release-fast-boot` (no change,
  no serial window, falsifier 3's ±1 ms) plus the D-0078 campaign
  canary. The T4.8b exhibits keep their pins. The README headline
  now cites T4.8c (`a8a1387`): published ratios moved from
  **5.5× / 18.3×** to **5.1× / 17.8×**; `t48b` stays pinned as
  the before. Revisit if the pinned kernel version ever changes:
  the `__setup` parameter's existence and semantics were read out
  of 6.18.7 and must be re-verified on any other tree.

## D-0082: Record two Linux-side audit disclosures that do not depend on T4.8c
- Date: 2026-08-21 — Status: accepted (record entry; consequences
  name deferred edits, not performed here)
- **Decision:** record two findings from the 2026-08-21 Linux-side
  fairness audit that stand regardless of whether D-0081's
  campaign runs.
- **Item 1 — the pre-guest slice scales with bytes loaded;
  `results/README.md`'s constancy sentence is false as written.**
  `results/README.md` states S "is a per-host, per-QEMU-build
  constant. It does not scale with the guest profile." Measured
  across the 300 recorded T4.8b trials by two independent
  read-only methods (a pcap-anchored proxy; guest-stamp-anchored
  brackets), the pre-guest slice of E0→E4 scales with the bytes
  QEMU loads, roughly **0.35–0.60 ms/MB**: the Linux arms carry a
  component Whimbrel does not pay — about **6–13 ms (trimmed)**
  and **10–20 ms (stock)**; stock−trimmed ≈ 4–7 ms. Magnitude is
  method-dependent and only bracketable read-only (the wire ARP
  leaves somewhere inside a stamped `sendto` interior; pcap
  frame-write latency is unquantified). Charging a VM for loading
  its own image is defensible — a small image is a real unikernel
  property — but the sentence is contradicted by the data, and
  the component is larger than the one bias the README names
  (the 2.87 ms D-0075 round trip). **Consequences (deferred,
  named so they are not lost):** correct the `results/README.md`
  sentence to say S is per-host *per-image-size*; add the
  size-scaling component, as a bracket, beside the neigh bias
  wherever that bias is disclosed (README, cross-system exhibit
  notes). Per-Linux-arm S is not recomputable from the pinned
  CSVs alone (no `synack_to_http_ns` column, no committed T4.8b
  batch header); any published bracket must say which method
  produced it.
- **Item 2 — an unexplained 12–15 ms interior in the announce
  `sendto` on Linux's measured path (open observation, not a
  conclusion).** The `/init` stamp bracket T_NEIGH→T_ANNOUNCE —
  one UDP `sendto` to the gateway, including the ARP solicit it
  forces — is **12.1 ms (trimmed), 12.2 ms (instrumented),
  15.1 ms (stock)** median across the T4.8b trials, IQR
  ~0.1–0.24 ms: real, arm-dependent, and decomposed by no
  exhibit. Where within it the ARP frame leaves the guest is not
  observable from the retained artifacts. Per the threats item-19
  discipline, this interval spans guest stack, virtio, and slirp
  boundaries and is **not attributed** to any of them without an
  instrument that sees the boundary (a guest stamp around
  `arp_send`, or a QEMU trace — the latter would change the
  measured configuration). Recorded so it is not rediscovered;
  a future entry may register an instrument.
- **Rationale:** both items are audit outputs whose evidence lives
  in retained artifacts; recording them next to the decisions they
  qualify is the log's job (D-0064 discipline: misses next to
  wins).
- **Consequences:** the two deferred edits named in item 1; item 2
  is a candidate instrument registration, nothing more. Revisit
  item 2 if any campaign's announce bracket moves regime or if a
  boundary instrument is registered.
