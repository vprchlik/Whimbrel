# PLAN — rv64gc Unikernel

Long-term plan for a minimal RISC-V (rv64gc) unikernel in Rust, running on
QEMU's `virt` machine over OpenSBI, with a single application compiled into the
image running in U-mode over a 5-syscall interface, plus a benchmark report
against a minimal Linux VM.

## How to read this document

- **Milestones M0–M4 are a fixed sequence.** Each milestone's acceptance test
  defines "done". No milestone starts before the previous one's acceptance test
  passes.
- **Effort tiers** (per task, not per milestone):
  - **S (small)** — one focused sitting; tens of lines; low bug risk.
  - **M (medium)** — one or two sittings including reading; moderate bug risk;
    may need one GDB session.
  - **L (large)** — several sittings; high bug risk; expect dedicated debugging
    time and re-reading of the spec. There are only a handful of L tasks in the
    whole project — they are the intellectual core.
- **Units of work, not calendar time.** Nothing here is scheduled. A milestone
  is done when its acceptance test passes and the end-of-milestone ritual
  (glossary/decisions update) is complete.
- Every milestone is now detailed to individual-task resolution below. M3 and
  M4 were intentionally kept at task-list resolution until their milestone
  start — the first action at each was expanding its section to full
  resolution using what prior milestones taught us, with sign-off before
  code. M3's expansion happened at its start; M4's happened 2026-08-16
  (T4.0), preceded by the whole-tree audit recorded in
  `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`.

# M0 — Boot

**Goal:** QEMU with `-bios default` loads OpenSBI, OpenSBI jumps to our kernel
in S-mode at 0x8020_0000, the kernel prints a hello message over the UART (via
the SBI console), then shuts the machine down so QEMU exits cleanly with code 0.

## Prerequisite concepts

Understand each of these before (or while) doing the tasks. Each is a concept
you should be able to explain out loud, unprompted.

**1. RISC-V privilege levels (M/S/U).** A RISC-V hart executes at one of three
privilege levels: Machine (M) is the highest and is where firmware lives with
full hardware access; Supervisor (S) is where operating systems live, with
access to virtual memory control and a subset of CSRs; User (U) is where
applications live, with no CSR access. Privilege only changes via traps (going
up) and the `mret`/`sret` instructions (going down). Our kernel spends its whole
life in S-mode; OpenSBI stays resident in M-mode and services our `ecall`s; the
app will eventually run in U-mode.

**2. SBI and the boot chain.** The Supervisor Binary Interface is the "syscall
interface" between an S-mode kernel and M-mode firmware: the kernel loads a
function/extension ID into registers and executes `ecall`, trapping into M-mode
where OpenSBI handles it (console output, setting timers, shutting down). The
boot chain on QEMU `virt` is: QEMU's built-in ROM at 0x1000 runs a few
instructions, jumps to OpenSBI at 0x8000_0000 (start of RAM), OpenSBI sets up
M-mode (PMP, trap delegation), then `mret`s into our kernel at 0x8020_0000 in
S-mode with `a0 = hartid` and `a1 = pointer to the device tree blob`.

**3. The QEMU `virt` memory map.** Physical RAM starts at 0x8000_0000 (default
128 MiB, so it ends at 0x8800_0000). OpenSBI occupies the first ~322 KiB of
RAM (observed: `Firmware Base 0x80000000`, `Firmware Size 322 KB`) and
protects itself with PMP — touching it from S-mode causes an access
fault, which is a classic mystery crash. Memory-mapped devices live below RAM:
UART (NS16550A) at 0x1000_0000, virtio-mmio slots at 0x1000_1000–0x1000_8000,
PLIC at 0x0C00_0000, CLINT at 0x0200_0000, and the "test finisher" device at
0x0010_0000. There is no BIOS-style firmware to enumerate any of this; addresses
come from the device tree or (our approach) from reading QEMU's source and
hardcoding them with a comment.

**4. Linker scripts, link address vs. load address.** The compiler emits code
that assumes it will run at specific addresses (for absolute references and for
the entry point). The linker script is where we state that assumption: we place
our first section at 0x8020_0000 because that is where QEMU loads a `-kernel`
payload and where OpenSBI jumps. If the link address and the actual load/jump
address disagree, the very first instruction fetch or the first absolute load
goes to the wrong place and the machine hangs with zero output — the most
common M0 failure. We also use the script to define symbols (`__bss_start`,
`__kernel_end`, stack top) that startup code needs.

**5. What Rust code needs before it can run.** Unlike a hosted program, nothing
has prepared the world for us: there is no stack pointer, `.bss` (all zero-
initialized statics) is whatever RAM happened to contain, and there is no
`main` caller. Our handwritten assembly entry must: set `sp` to a stack we
reserved in the linker script, zero `.bss`, and only then call Rust. Rust
additionally requires a `#[panic_handler]` because `core` needs somewhere to go
when an invariant fails — ours will print the panic location and message
(failing loudly) once the console works.

**6. Console options: SBI console vs. raw UART driver.** Two ways to print: (a)
ask OpenSBI via an `ecall` to output a byte (it owns the UART already, this is
~10 lines), or (b) drive the NS16550A registers at 0x1000_0000 ourselves.
For M0 we use the SBI console — it is the minimal, legible choice and works
even before we map any device memory in M1. A raw UART driver is deliberately
out of scope until/unless a later milestone needs it (decision D-0004 territory;
revisit only if M3 interrupt-driven console I/O demands it).

**7. Exiting QEMU cleanly.** "Kill the terminal" is not an acceptance test. Two
clean mechanisms: the SBI system reset extension (`SRST`, EID 0x53525354) asks
OpenSBI to shut down, which QEMU implements as process exit; or writing magic
values to the sifive-test device at 0x0010_0000 (0x5555 = pass). We use SBI
SRST as the primary mechanism (consistent with "talk to firmware, not raw
hardware, until we must") — see D-0011. A clean exit also unlocks scripted
testing: `just test` can run QEMU headless and inspect its output and exit.

## Tasks

### T0.1 — Verify the environment boots OpenSBI alone — S
Follow `docs/SETUP.md`; run bare QEMU with no kernel.

- **Acceptance:** `qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -nographic -bios default`
  prints the OpenSBI banner (version line, platform `riscv-virtio,qemu`).
  Without a `-kernel`, `Domain0 Next Address` is `0x0` — OpenSBI has nowhere
  to jump. With our kernel it is `0x80200000` in S-mode (already observed).
  Exit with `Ctrl-a x`.

### T0.2 — Kernel entry: linker script + assembly `_start` — M
The scaffolding (linker script, `_start` that sets `sp` and parks) already
exists; this task is to *understand* it line by line, then extend `_start` to
zero `.bss` and `call kmain` passing through `a0`/`a1`.

- **Acceptance (no console yet, so we use GDB):** `just debug` in one terminal,
  `just gdb` in another; `break kmain`, `continue` stops in `kmain` with
  `p/x $sp` inside our stack region, `p/x $a0` = 0 (hartid) and `p/x $a1`
  pointing into high RAM (the DTB). `info registers sstatus` confirms S-mode
  context as set up by OpenSBI.

### T0.3 — SBI console output + `println!` — M
An `sbi` module with a raw `ecall` wrapper; DBCN `console_write_byte`
(EID `0x4442434E`, FID 2 — see D-0015); a `core::fmt::Write` implementation
and `print!`/`println!` macros. Probe DBCN via BASE before the first write.

- **Acceptance:** `just run` prints exactly:
  ```
  whimbrel: hello from hart 0, dtb at 0x<some address in RAM>
  ```
  after the OpenSBI banner.

### T0.4 — Panic handler that prints, then parks — S
Replace the parking panic handler: print `PANIC at <file>:<line>: <message>`
via the console, then `wfi` loop. Verify with a deliberate `panic!` then remove
it.

- **Acceptance:** a temporary `panic!("selftest")` in `kmain` produces
  `PANIC at src/main.rs:<line>: selftest` on the serial output.

### T0.5 — Clean shutdown via SBI SRST — S
`sbi::shutdown()` using the SRST extension; call it at the end of `kmain`,
printing a final marker line first.

- **Acceptance:** `just run` prints `M0 BOOT OK`, QEMU's process exits on its
  own (no `Ctrl-a x`), and `echo $?` is `0`.

### T0.6 — Wire the headless boot test — S
Make `just test` assert on the kernel marker, not the OpenSBI banner.
Timeout is a hang-guard (~3s), not the normal path. Verdict from serial +
QEMU status together (D-0017): `PANIC` → FAIL; timeout → HANG; marker +
exit 0 → PASS.

- **Acceptance:** `just test` prints `TEST PASS: found "M0 BOOT OK"` and
  exits 0. `just test-panic` prints `TEST FAIL: panic` and the panic line,
  exit 1. `just test-hang` prints `TEST HANG` and exit 2.

## Milestone acceptance test

```
$ just test
```
prints `TEST PASS: found "M0 BOOT OK"` and exits 0. And interactively:
```
$ just run
... OpenSBI banner ...
whimbrel: hello from hart 0, dtb at 0x87e00000
M0 BOOT OK
$ echo $?
0
```
(The exact DTB address may differ; it must lie in RAM.)

## Risks and likely failure modes

- **Silent hang, no output at all:** link address ≠ 0x8020_0000; entry section
  not placed first in the image; ELF entry point not `_start`. Check
  `just objdump` / `readelf -l` before suspecting anything else.
- **Hang or garbage after some output:** `sp` not set or set to unmapped/too-low
  address; `.bss` not zeroed (statics contain junk — symptoms often deferred
  and weird).
- **Access fault immediately:** touched OpenSBI's protected RAM below
  0x8020_0000 (PMP violation).
- **`ecall` returns garbage / no output:** wrong register convention — SBI takes
  EID in `a7`, FID in `a6`, args in `a0..a5`; legacy extensions differ (no FID).
- **Works interactively, test hangs:** kernel never calls shutdown, so headless
  QEMU never exits — the test recipe uses `timeout` as a hang-guard (exit 2),
  but the acceptance requires a real clean exit.

## M0 summary

**Produced:** a `no_std` rv64gc kernel that OpenSBI enters at `0x80200000` in
S-mode, zeros `.bss`, prints over DBCN, panics loudly with a reentrancy
guard, and shuts down via SRST so QEMU exits 0. `just test` is a CI-shaped
gate on that path.

**Acceptance proves:** `just test` finds `M0 BOOT OK` and exits 0; `just run`
prints the hello line (DTB in RAM) plus `M0 BOOT OK` and returns 0. The
harness also distinguishes panic (FAIL) from timeout (HANG).

**Decisions this milestone:** D-0015 DBCN `write_byte` (no legacy putchar);
D-0016 unmapped stack guard page (accepted, deferred to M1/T1.5); D-0017
SRST shutdown, no guest-controlled exit code, harness parses serial.

# M1 — Fundamentals

**Goal:** the kernel can take traps without dying (printing full diagnostic
state for unexpected ones), receives timer interrupts via SBI, owns physical
memory through a frame allocator, runs with Sv39 paging enabled and the kernel
identity-mapped with correct permissions, and has a working heap (`Box`, `Vec`).

## Prerequisite concepts

**1. CSRs — control and status registers.** CSRs are per-hart registers
addressed by number, accessed only via `csrr`/`csrw`/`csrs`/`csrc`
instructions, that configure privileged behavior. The S-mode set we care about:
`stvec` (trap vector address), `sstatus` (global state incl. interrupt-enable
bit SIE and previous-privilege bit SPP), `sie`/`sip` (which interrupt classes
are enabled/pending), `scause`/`sepc`/`stval` (what/where/detail of the last
trap), `satp` (paging mode + root page table), and `sscratch` (a free register
for the trap handler's use). Reading them is also our main debugging tool.

**2. What the hardware does on a trap — exactly.** When a trap targets S-mode,
the hart atomically: saves the interrupted `pc` into `sepc`, writes the cause
into `scause` (top bit = interrupt vs. exception), writes a cause-specific
detail into `stval` (e.g. the faulting address), saves the current interrupt-
enable state (`sstatus.SIE → sstatus.SPIE`, then clears SIE) and privilege
(`sstatus.SPP`), and jumps to the address in `stvec`. **Nothing else is saved.**
All 31 general-purpose registers still contain the interrupted code's values —
saving and restoring them is entirely our job, which is why the trap handler
begins and ends in assembly. `sret` reverses the process: restores privilege
from SPP, interrupt state from SPIE, and jumps to `sepc`.

**3. Interrupts vs. exceptions, and delegation.** Exceptions are synchronous
(caused by the executing instruction: illegal instruction, page fault, `ecall`);
interrupts are asynchronous (timer, external device, software). By default all
traps go to M-mode; OpenSBI sets `medeleg`/`mideleg` at boot to delegate most
S-relevant traps down to us — that's the only reason our `stvec` ever fires.
An interrupt is taken only when its bit is set in `sie` AND `sstatus.SIE` is
set (when in S-mode) AND it is pending in `sip`.

**4. Time and timers via SBI.** rv64 harts expose a real-time counter readable
via `rdtime`; on QEMU `virt` it ticks at 10 MHz (`timebase-frequency` in the
DTB). There is no "periodic timer" — there is one comparator: you ask for the
next interrupt at an absolute counter value via the SBI TIME extension
(`sbi_set_timer`), the timer interrupt fires when `time >=` that value, and the
handler must arm the next one itself. Forgetting to re-arm (interrupt fires
once, never again) and forgetting that the argument is absolute, not a delta,
are the two classic bugs.

**5. Physical memory and frame allocation.** After boot we own RAM from the end
of our kernel image (`__kernel_end`, from the linker script) to the end of RAM
(0x8800_0000 with QEMU's default 128 MiB — we hardcode this and assert against
it rather than parse the DTB; see D-0012). Paging hardware deals in 4 KiB
pages, so we manage this range as 4 KiB frames. Design: a free-list allocator
(each free frame stores the address of the next free frame in its own first 8
bytes) — O(1) alloc/free, ~60 lines, zero metadata overhead, and trivially
explainable. Everything that needs memory later (page tables, heap, task
stacks) sits on top of this.

**6. Sv39 address translation.** Sv39 maps 39-bit virtual addresses using a
three-level radix tree of 512-entry, 4 KiB page tables: VA bits [38:30] index
level 2, [29:21] level 1, [20:12] level 0, [11:0] carry through as the page
offset. Each PTE holds a physical page number plus flag bits — V (valid),
R/W/X (permissions; if any of R/W/X is set the PTE is a leaf, at any level —
that's how 2 MiB and 1 GiB "megapages" work), U (U-mode accessible), A/D
(accessed/dirty), G (global). Bits [63:39] of a valid VA must equal bit 38
(sign extension) — kernel addresses like 0x8020_0000 are fine. Translation is
activated by writing `satp` = mode 8 (Sv39) | root table's physical page
number.

**7. The TLB and `sfence.vma`.** The hart caches translations in a TLB and is
allowed to keep using stale entries after you edit page tables or switch
`satp`. `sfence.vma` flushes those cached translations. Rule for this project:
execute `sfence.vma` after writing `satp` and after any PTE modification. With
a single address space this costs almost nothing and eliminates an entire
class of "works until it doesn't" bugs. Related QEMU-specific gotcha: set the
A and D bits in kernel PTEs up front — implementations (QEMU included,
depending on version/config) may fault instead of setting them in hardware.

**8. A heap in `no_std` Rust.** `alloc` (`Box`, `Vec`, `String`) becomes
available in `no_std` the moment we provide a `#[global_allocator]`
implementing `GlobalAlloc` (`alloc`/`dealloc` with size+alignment). We
hand-roll a simple allocator (linked-list of free blocks over a fixed heap
region built from frames) rather than pull in a crate — the point is being
able to defend it (D-0013). Allocation failure panics loudly with the
requested size; there is no OOM recovery story in a unikernel.

**9. Delegation is not universal — read `medeleg`.** OpenSBI chooses which
exceptions reach S-mode, and the boot log tells us exactly which. Observed on
OpenSBI v1.3 / QEMU `virt`: `MEDELEG = 0xf0b509` delegates exception codes 0
(instruction address misaligned), 3 (breakpoint), 8 (`ecall` from U-mode), 10
(`ecall` from VS-mode, H-extension; bit 10 is set in the observed mask), 12,
13, 15 (the three page faults), plus the H-extension guest-fault codes 20–23.
It does **not** delegate 1 (instruction access fault), 2 (illegal instruction),
4/6 (misaligned load/store), 5/7 (load/store access fault), or 9 (`ecall` from
S-mode — that one is how we call SBI). `MIDELEG = 0x1666` includes bit 5, so
supervisor timer interrupts do reach us. Two consequences: we cannot test our
own handler with an illegal instruction, and a wild pointer into OpenSBI's
PMP-protected RAM produces a *firmware* trap dump rather than ours. Knowing
which codes can possibly arrive is what makes the "unknown trap" panic arm
meaningful instead of decorative.

**10. The CLINT is closed to S-mode.** OpenSBI's PMP setup prints
`Region00: 0x02000000-0x0200ffff M: (I,R,W) S/U: ()`. The timer comparator
`mtimecmp` lives in that range, so S-mode cannot write it: the store raises an
access fault, and access faults are not delegated, so our handler would never
even see the failure. This single hardware fact reduces "how do we arm a
timer" to exactly two options — an SBI call into M-mode, or the Sstc
extension's `stimecmp` CSR (see D-0018).

**11. What makes the instruction after `csrw satp` fetch successfully.**
`satp` is written as `MODE(=8, Sv39) << 60 | ASID(=0) << 44 | PPN(root)`, where
PPN is the root table's physical address shifted right by 12. The write takes
effect for this hart immediately. The **next instruction fetch** — at the
address right after the `csrw`, and since we are identity mapped that is
numerically the same address it was a cycle ago — is no longer a direct
physical access. The hardware walker now performs, for that fetch: read the
root table at `satp.PPN << 12` and index it with virtual address bits [38:30];
if that entry is a pointer, read the level-1 table and index with bits [29:21];
if that entry is a pointer, read the level-0 table and index with bits [20:12];
take the leaf's PPN and concatenate the page offset from bits [11:0].

For that fetch to succeed, **all** of the following must already be true
before the `csrw` retires:

1. `satp.MODE` is 8. If it is 0, translation never turns on and the whole
   thing silently no-ops — you believe paging is live and it is not.
2. `satp.PPN` is the root table's physical address **shifted right 12**, not
   the address itself. Writing the address is a factor-of-4096 error that
   lands the walker on garbage.
3. The root table's entry for the PC's bits [38:30] has V=1.
4. Every intermediate entry on the walk has V=1 and R=W=X=0. A non-leaf with
   any of R/W/X set *is* a leaf; the walk stops early and either resolves to
   the wrong physical page or faults as a misaligned superpage.
5. The leaf has V=1 and X=1.
6. The leaf has U=0. In S-mode, a leaf marked U=1 is inaccessible for
   instruction fetch, and `sstatus.SUM` does not help — SUM affects loads and
   stores only, never fetches. This is a corner that bites people in M2.
7. The leaf has A=1, and D=1 for anything we will write. QEMU may fault rather
   than set these itself, depending on version and configuration, so we set
   them up front on every kernel leaf.
8. The leaf's PPN maps back to the same physical frame, so the bytes fetched
   are the instruction we compiled.
9. The page tables themselves are at physical addresses the walker can read,
   and PMP permits it. The walker uses physical addressing, so the tables do
   **not** need to be mapped for the walk to work — but *we* need them mapped
   to edit them afterwards, which identity mapping gives us free.
10. The stack is mapped R+W before the next prologue, and `ra` points into
    mapped X memory before the next `ret`.
11. `stvec`'s target page is mapped X and the handler's stack is mapped W —
    because if any of 1–10 is wrong, the resulting page fault vectors there,
    and if that page is also unmapped the fault faults, forever, with no
    output. That is the silent hang.
12. **No interrupt arrives during the transition.** If `sstatus.SIE` is set and
    the timer fires between the `csrw` and the `sfence.vma`, we take a trap
    through a mapping we have not yet validated. Since T1.3 turns on 10 ms
    ticks before T1.7 runs, this window is not hypothetical (see D-0022).

Then `sfence.vma` with both operands zero, flushing everything. QEMU flushes on
a `satp` write in practice, but the specification does not promise it, and a
kernel that depends on unpromised behavior is a kernel that works until it does
not.

This enumeration is also the strongest available defense of D-0006: identity
mapping means the PC, the stack pointer, and every return address keep their
numeric values across the switch. A higher-half kernel has to map both the old
and new views, jump, then drop the old one. That trampoline is why xv6 and
Linux look the way they do here. We did not need that trampoline.

**12. Instruction width and `sepc`.** For an exception we resume *past*
(`ebreak` in M1, `ecall` in M2), the handler must add the trapped
instruction's width, because `sepc` points *at* the offending instruction and
`sret` would re-execute it forever. Width comes from the low two bits of the
instruction halfword at `sepc`: `0b11` means 4 bytes, anything else means 2
(the C extension). For an **interrupt**, do not touch `sepc` — it already
points at the instruction that has not run yet, and advancing it skips an
instruction, silently, until the consequence is inexplicable. Two rules, one
CSR; conflating them is a classic bug (see D-0021).

## Kernel address space — the M1 target

Single root table, identity mapped (VA = PA), one address space for the
lifetime of the system (D-0006). Addresses below are after T1.5 inserts the
guard page, which shifts everything above `.bss` up by one page.

| Region | Range | Permissions | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenSBI firmware | `[RAM_START, __kernel_start)` | **not mapped** | PMP already denies S-mode. Unmapped means a stray access is a page fault we decode, not an access fault firmware absorbs. |
| Kernel `.text` | `[__kernel_start, __rodata_start)` | R + X | Executable, never writable. |
| `.rodata` | `[__rodata_start, __data_start)` | R | No X, so a jump into a string constant faults. |
| `.data` + `.bss` | `[__data_start, __bss_end)` | R + W | No X. |
| Stack guard | `[__bss_end, __boot_stack_bottom)` | **not mapped** | D-0016. Overflow becomes a store page fault instead of silent `.bss` corruption. |
| Boot stack | `[__boot_stack_bottom, __boot_stack_top)` | R + W | 64 KiB, grows down into the guard. |
| Heap | `[__heap_start, __heap_end)` | R + W | Carved before the free list (D-0024). |
| Free frames | `[__heap_end, RAM_END)` | R + W | Page tables and, later, task stacks come from here (D-0019). |
| MMIO (UART, virtio, sifive_test) | — | **not mapped** | D-0025. Console is an `ecall`; virtio is M3. |

Numeric bounds come from the linker and `frame::RAM_END`, not from literals in this table. T1.6 maps by those symbols. After T1.5: `__kernel_start = 0x8020_0000`, `__boot_stack_bottom = __bss_end + 0x1000`, `__heap_end = __heap_start + 1 MiB`, `RAM_END = 0x8800_0000`.

Every leaf carries A+D. Nothing outside these ranges is mapped at all, which is
what makes both T1.7 fault probes meaningful: `0x9000_0000` is past the end of
RAM, and the guard page is a hole inside it.

## Tasks

Ten tasks. T1.0 is harness plumbing every later acceptance line depends on.
T1.6 and T1.7 are deliberately split so the page tables are *validated in
software* before they are activated — the split exists because activation is
the one step in this project whose failure mode is a silent hang with no
output.

### T1.0 — Restore `expect` parameterization in the harness — S
T0.6 replaced the old `just test expect=…` interface with
`scripts/boot-test.sh` reading an `EXPECT` environment variable, so every
per-task acceptance line below needs a one-command form. Add an `expect`
parameter (and a `timeout_s` parameter) back to the `test` recipe, passing
through to the script's environment.

- **Acceptance:** `just test expect="M0 BOOT OK"` prints
  `TEST PASS: found "M0 BOOT OK"` and exits 0; `just test-panic` still exits 1
  and `just test-hang` still exits 2.

### T1.1 — CSR access module — S
`csr` module: read/write/set/clear helpers for `sstatus`, `sie`, `sip`,
`stvec`, `scause`, `sepc`, `stval`, `satp`, and `time` (macro or per-CSR
functions — keep it boring), plus named bit constants with spec citations.

- **Acceptance:** boot prints `sstatus`, `sie`, `stvec`, `satp` as hex;
  `satp` reads 0 (Bare mode, paging not yet on) and `stvec` reads whatever
  OpenSBI left. `just test expect="CSR OK"` passes.

### T1.2 — Trap entry, frame, and dispatch — L
Assembly `__trap_entry`: reserve 272 bytes on the current stack, save all 31
GPRs plus `sepc` and `sstatus` at register-indexed offsets, pass the frame
pointer to Rust `trap_handler(&mut TrapFrame)`, restore, `sret`. `stvec` set
to it in Direct mode (4-byte alignment is mandatory — the low two bits are the
mode field). Layout and the four M2-proofing constraints per D-0020; `sepc`
advance per D-0021. Rust dispatch on `scause`: known causes handled,
**everything unknown panics printing decoded `scause`, `sepc`, and `stval`**
per the fail-loudly rule.

- **Acceptance:** a deliberate `unsafe { asm!("ebreak") }` in `kmain` prints a
  trap report with `scause=3 (breakpoint)` and `sepc` equal to the `ebreak`
  address, then execution *continues* past it and prints `TRAP OK`.
  `just test expect="TRAP OK"` passes. Second check, now that `stvec` is
  installed: `just panic` still prints its `PANIC at …` line (a panic arriving
  from a trap context is a different situation than one from `kmain`).

### T1.3 — Timer interrupts via SBI TIME — M
Probe the TIME extension via BASE (same shape as the DBCN and SRST probes),
enable `sie.STIE` and `sstatus.SIE`, arm the first deadline, and on each
supervisor-timer interrupt increment a tick counter and re-arm at
`rdtime() + 100_000` (10 ms at 10 MHz). Print a line every 10 ticks. Keep the
arm in a single function so the M4 Sstc comparison is a one-site change
(D-0018).

- **Acceptance:** `just test expect="tick 30"` passes — 30 ticks is 0.3 s,
  comfortably inside the 3 s hang-guard. Serial shows `tick 10`, `tick 20`,
  `tick 30`.

### T1.4 — Physical frame allocator — M
Intrusive free-list allocator over `[heap_end, RAM_END)`, where the heap region
is carved first (D-0024) and `RAM_END` is the hardcoded `0x8800_0000` validated
per D-0023. Each free frame stores its successor in its own first 8 bytes, so
total metadata is one head pointer in `.bss`. `alloc_frame()` returns a zeroed
4 KiB-aligned frame; `free_frame()` pushes it back. Panics on exhaustion with
the frame count; panics on the cheap double-free check (freeing the current
head).

- **Acceptance:** boot self-test allocates two frames (distinct, aligned,
  zeroed), frees the first, reallocates and gets it back (LIFO); prints the
  total frame count and `FRAME OK`. `just test expect="FRAME OK"` passes.

### T1.5 — Linker script: guard-page hole and heap symbols — S
Insert an unmapped 4 KiB hole between `__bss_end` and `__boot_stack_bottom`
(implements D-0016 — today they are the same address, so overflow walks
straight into `.bss`), and export heap-region symbols for T1.8. Everything
above shifts up by one page.

- **Acceptance:** `nm` shows `__boot_stack_bottom == __bss_end + 0x1000`; the
  kernel still boots and `just test expect="M0 BOOT OK"` passes.

### T1.6 — Build the page tables *without* activating them — M
Page-table module: PTE type with flag constants, and `map(root, va, pa, flags)`
walking and creating intermediate tables from the frame allocator. Build the
kernel address space per D-0019, D-0025, and D-0026: `.text` R+X, `.rodata` R,
`.data`/`.bss` R+W, guard page absent, stack R+W, heap R+W, all remaining RAM
R+W, OpenSBI's region and all MMIO unmapped, A+D set on every leaf, 4 KiB
leaves only. Then walk the finished tables **in software** (raw PTE decode by
bit position — not the mapper's helpers) and print the resolved translation
and permissions for a list of probes: kernel entry, a `.text` address, a
`.rodata` address, a stack address, a heap address, the guard page, and
`0x9000_0000`. Print the root PA and the `satp` value we would write. Nothing
touches `satp`.

- **Acceptance:** the printed walk matches expected permissions for every
  probe, the guard page and `0x9000_0000` both resolve to "unmapped", and
  `just test expect="PAGETABLE OK"` passes. This is the task that makes T1.7
  survivable: you verify the map is right before betting the machine on it.

### T1.7 — Activate paging — L
Clear `sstatus.SIE` (D-0022 — timer ticks have been live since T1.3), write
`satp`, `sfence.vma`, restore `SIE`, and keep executing. Prerequisite concept
11 is the checklist for this task; DEBUGGING.md §4 has the first-response
procedure when it hangs.

- **Acceptance:** prints `PAGING OK` after the switch; a deliberate read of
  `0x9000_0000` panics with `scause=13 (load page fault)`,
  `stval=0x90000000`; a deliberate write into the guard page panics with
  `scause=15 (store page fault)` and `stval` inside the guard. All three
  observed in one `just run`. The two fault probes are then removed and
  `just test expect="PAGING OK"` passes.

### T1.8 — Heap allocator — M
Linked-list free-block allocator over the reserved heap region behind
`#[global_allocator]`, `extern crate alloc`. Honors `Layout::align()`. Panics
on exhaustion with the requested size and alignment.

- **Acceptance:** boot self-test: `Box::new(42)`, a `Vec` grown to 10_000
  elements (forces realloc), a `String`, drop everything, allocate again;
  prints `HEAP OK`. `just test expect="HEAP OK"` passes.

### T1.9 — Milestone wrap — S
Print the final marker, update the harness default marker to
`M1 FUNDAMENTALS OK`, update GLOSSARY and DECISIONS.

- **Acceptance:** `just test` (no arguments) passes on the new default marker.

## Milestone acceptance test

```
$ just test
```
prints `TEST PASS: found "M1 FUNDAMENTALS OK"` and exits 0, and the serial log
from `just run` contains, in order: `CSR OK`, `TRAP OK`, `tick 10`, `tick 20`,
`tick 30`, `FRAME OK`, `PAGETABLE OK`, `PAGING OK`, `HEAP OK`,
`M1 FUNDAMENTALS OK`, then a clean exit 0. The deliberate page-fault probes
from T1.6 and T1.7 are per-task checks and are **not** present in the final
run.

## Risks and likely failure modes

- **T1.2:** `stvec`'s low two bits are a *mode* field, so an unaligned handler
  address silently changes trap mode instead of being rejected. A single
  clobbered register in save/restore causes corruption that surfaces far from
  the trap — diff the frame in GDB rather than reading the assembly again.
  Taking a trap before `stvec` is set, or inside the handler, is an instant
  hang. Note also that codes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are **not delegated** on
  this platform (prerequisite concept 9): if you are hunting a fault and our
  handler is silent while OpenSBI prints a dump, that is why — not a bug in
  our dispatch.
- **T1.3:** `sie.STIE` and `sstatus.SIE` are both required and are easy to
  confuse. The SBI timer argument is an **absolute** counter value, not a
  delta. `sip.STIP` is not write-clearable from S-mode — re-arming *is* the
  acknowledgement, so "forgot to re-arm" presents as either one interrupt ever
  or an interrupt storm depending on which half you got wrong.
- **T1.4:** the free list lives *inside* the frames it manages, so it depends
  on all of RAM being addressable (D-0019). The DTB at `0x87e0_0000` sits
  inside the range handed to the allocator and will eventually be clobbered —
  which is fine, but only if the D-0023 sanity check runs *before* allocator
  init.
- **T1.5:** the guard page shifts the stack and `__kernel_end`; anything that
  hardcoded a stack address needs to follow.
- **T1.7:** the project's first cliff. If the currently-executing PC is not
  mapped X you take an instruction page fault whose handler is also unmapped:
  a tight trap loop with no output, debuggable only via QEMU `-d int` and the
  monitor. Missing A/D bits fault on some QEMU configurations. Forgetting
  `sfence.vma` works until it does not. Wrong `satp.PPN` shift is a
  factor-of-4096 error. A timer interrupt inside the transition window
  vectors through a mapping that has not been validated (D-0022).
- **T1.8:** `GlobalAlloc` must honor `Layout::align()`, not just size. The
  heap region must come from the reserved carve-out rather than being placed
  by hand, or it will overlap the frame allocator's range.

## M1 summary

**Produced:** an S-mode kernel that takes delegated traps (Direct `stvec`,
register-indexed `TrapFrame`), arms 10 ms ticks through SBI TIME, owns RAM
as 4 KiB frames above a 1 MiB heap carve-out, identity-maps that RAM in Sv39
with W^X and an unmapped stack-guard hole, and serves `Box`/`Vec`/`String`
from a coalescing first-fit heap. Paging is validated in software (T1.6)
before `satp` is written (T1.7). Page-fault probes and the T1.6 walk table
are per-task checks and are not in the final image.

**Acceptance proves:** `just test` finds `M1 FUNDAMENTALS OK` and exits 0.
`just run` prints, in order, `CSR OK`, `TRAP OK`, `tick 10`, `tick 20`,
`tick 30`, `FRAME OK`, `PAGETABLE OK`, `PAGING OK`, `HEAP OK`,
`M1 FUNDAMENTALS OK`, then QEMU exits 0. `just test-panic` / `just test-hang`
still distinguish FAIL from HANG.

**Decisions this milestone:** D-0018 SBI TIME not Sstc; D-0019 map all of
RAM R+W, intrusive frame list; D-0020 `TrapFrame` / Direct `stvec`; D-0021
instruction width from the trapped bits, never on interrupts; D-0022 clear
`sstatus.SIE` across `satp`; D-0023 hardcoded `RAM_END`, DTB header check
then clobber; D-0024 1 MiB heap carve-out before the free list; D-0025 no
MMIO in M1; D-0026 4 KiB leaves only, no superpages; D-0027 address-sorted
heap free list, coalesce on free, first-fit.

# M2 — Execution

**Goal:** two or more kernel-defined tasks run in U-mode, invoke the 5 syscalls
(`write`, `exit`, `sbrk`, `gettime`, `yield`) via `ecall`, and are preemptively
scheduled round-robin off the timer interrupt.

**Decisions recorded before any code:** D-0029 `sscratch` protocol; D-0030
static per-task stacks with guard holes; D-0031 separate user sections, no
PTE edits after activation; D-0032 switch at trap exit, the trap frame *is*
the task context; D-0033 syscall ABI; D-0034 user-pointer validation and the
`SUM` window; D-0035 slice = one tick, no idle loop; D-0036 resolution of
D-0028.

## Prerequisite concepts

**1. There is no "enter user mode" instruction.** Privilege only drops via
`sret` (or `mret`). `sret` sets the privilege level from `sstatus.SPP`, sets
`sstatus.SIE` from `SPIE`, sets `SPP` back to U, and jumps to `sepc`. Every
one of those inputs is a register we control, which means entering U-mode for
the first time is *returning from a trap that never happened*: the kernel
fabricates the state a trap would have left behind (`sepc` = the task's entry
point, `SPP` = 0, a user `sp`) and executes `sret`. There is no separate
mechanism, and this is why the same assembly that returns from a syscall also
starts a brand-new task.

**2. Interrupts for higher privilege levels are always enabled.** The
privileged spec's global-enable rule is asymmetric: while executing at level
*x*, interrupts for levels *y > x* are always globally enabled regardless of
that level's `yIE` bit, and interrupts for levels *w < x* are always globally
disabled. Concretely: in U-mode, S-mode interrupts fire whether or not
`sstatus.SIE` is set (only `sie.STIE` and pending state matter), so user code
is *always* preemptible; in S-mode, `sstatus.SIE` gates them, and hardware
cleared it on trap entry and we never set it (D-0020), so kernel code is
*never* preempted. That single asymmetry is what makes M2's scheduler small:
there is exactly one point in the system where a task can lose the CPU.

**3. A pending timer during a syscall is deferred, not lost.** `sip.STIP` is
not write-clearable from S-mode; re-arming is the acknowledgement (D-0018). If
the deadline passes while a syscall is running, `STIP` stays set, `SIE=0`
suppresses the trap, and the interrupt is taken *immediately* after the `sret`
back to U-mode, because U-mode cannot mask S-mode interrupts (concept 2).
Expect preemption to land right after a syscall returns. Nothing is lost, and
the arm-at-`rdtime()+PERIOD` rule (D-0018) means a long syscall cannot leave
the comparator in the past.

**4. The `U` bit, and what `sstatus.SUM` does and does not buy.** A leaf PTE's
`U` bit says the page is reachable from U-mode. In S-mode, a load or store to
a `U=1` page raises a page fault *unless* `sstatus.SUM` is set; an
**instruction fetch** from a `U=1` page faults in S-mode always, `SUM` or not
(`SUM` covers loads and stores only; `MXR` only makes execute-only pages
readable). Two consequences shape the whole milestone. First, user code cannot
live in kernel `.text`: one page cannot be both S-fetchable and U-fetchable, so
user code needs its own sections. Second, the kernel cannot read a user buffer
without `SUM`, and with paging on there is no physical back door — every S-mode
load goes through the same translation and the same `U` check.

**5. Hardware does not validate pointers the kernel dereferences.** The `U`
bit protects *user → kernel*: a U-mode access to a `U=0` page faults with no
software involvement. It says nothing about *kernel-on-behalf-of-user*. With
`SUM=1` the kernel may read `U=1` pages, and it could always read `U=0` pages,
so a copy loop will faithfully read kernel `.bss` if the task passes that
address. In a single identity-mapped address space (D-0006) there is no
hardware check to switch on: validating a user pointer is software or it does
not happen.

**6. `sscratch` exists because every register belongs to the interrupted
context.** On a trap from U-mode all 31 GPRs still hold user values, `sp`
included. Pushing a trap frame at the trapped `sp` would let a task point `sp`
at kernel memory and have the kernel spill 272 bytes into it — permitted,
because S-mode stores to `U=0` pages are legal. `sscratch` is the one
architectural scratch slot the trap handler owns, and swapping it with `sp` is
the only way to obtain a trustworthy stack pointer without first having a free
register to compute one. The corollary is that the *discrimination* between a
trap from U and a trap from S must also ride on that swap: reading
`sstatus.SPP` needs a destination register, and at the first instruction of
the handler there is none.

**7. A task's whole context is the trap frame.** With no floating-point state
in scope (D-0002 defers FPU context switching; `sstatus.FS` stays `Off`), a
task's complete user context is 31 GPRs plus `sepc` and `sstatus` — exactly the
`TrapFrame` D-0020 already builds. Nothing else needs saving. So the task
control block stores no register state at all, only *where* its frame lives,
and a context switch is a change of which frame the trap epilogue restores.

**8. `gp` and `tp` are ABI registers with kernel meaning.** `_start` loads `gp`
with relaxation disabled precisely so the linker may relax kernel absolute
loads into cheaper `gp`-relative ones; kernel Rust code therefore *depends* on
`gp`. A trap from U-mode arrives with the user's `gp` still in the register, so
the entry must restore the kernel's before calling Rust or every relaxed static
access reads the wrong address — a bug that surfaces far from its cause. `tp`
is the thread pointer, used only for thread-locals, which `no_std` without TLS
never emits: the kernel never reads it, so it is saved and restored like any
other GPR and needs no reload.

**9. `ecall` has no compressed encoding.** RVC defines `c.ebreak` but no
`c.ecall`, so the syscall path advances `sepc` by the constant 4 with that
citation and never reads user memory to decide. This is D-0021 constraint 3
paying off: the alternative — decoding width from the instruction at `sepc` —
is a *load* from a user virtual address, which needs `SUM` in the hottest path
in the kernel and a fault story for a task that jumped somewhere unmapped.

**10. Kernel stack overflow is not a recoverable fault.** Once each task has
its own kernel stack, an overflow must be caught by an unmapped guard page or
it silently corrupts a neighbour. But trace what the guard actually produces:
the store page fault arrives from S-mode, so `sscratch` is 0, so trap entry
keeps the faulting `sp` — already inside the guard hole — and immediately
pushes 272 bytes through it, which faults again, forever, with no output. Rust
is never reached, so the panic printer and its `IN_PANIC` guard never run. The
guard converts silent neighbour corruption into a silent hang. That is a real
improvement (the damage stops) but it is not a diagnostic, and M2 does not fix
it (D-0030).

## Kernel + user address space — the M2 target

Every new region is **static and linker-placed**, inserted between the boot
stack and `__kernel_end` so the 1 MiB kernel-heap carve-out (D-0024) and the
frame free list keep their existing structure and simply start higher.
`MAX_TASKS` is a compile-time constant (4; the demo uses 2).

| Region | Permissions | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.utext` | R + X + **U** | User code cannot live in kernel `.text`: S-mode cannot fetch from a `U=1` page and U-mode cannot fetch from a `U=0` one (concept 4). |
| `.urodata` | R + **U** | Literals a task passes to `write` must be user-readable. A literal left in kernel `.rodata` faults on the task's own load. |
| `.udata` / `.ubss` | R + W + **U** | User statics. `.ubss` is NOLOAD. |
| Per-task user stack ×`MAX_TASKS` | R + W + **U** | 8 KiB each, NOLOAD, 4 KiB unmapped guard hole below each. |
| Per-task break window ×`MAX_TASKS` | R + W + **U** | 64 KiB each, NOLOAD. `sbrk` moves a pointer inside this; it never allocates or maps (D-0036). |
| Per-task kernel stack ×`MAX_TASKS` | R + W, **U=0** | 8 KiB each, NOLOAD, 4 KiB unmapped guard hole below each. `sscratch` holds the top (D-0029). |

Everything else is the M1 map unchanged. **No PTE is edited after
`page::activate`** (D-0031): the user map is built at boot beside the kernel
map, so M2 adds no `sfence.vma` site and no mapping work in the trap path.

## Tasks

Thirteen tasks. T2.2 is the T1.6-shaped safety net for T2.3 — verify the
`U` bits in software before betting the machine on the first `sret` to U.
T2.3 and T2.9 are the L tasks.

### T2.0 — `sscratch` accessor and boot-context assertions — S
Add `csr::sscratch`. Extend the boot CSR snapshot to print `sscratch` as
OpenSBI left it, then zero it in `trap::install()` **before** `stvec` is
written: a trap taken while `sscratch` holds firmware garbage would be
misread as a trap from U-mode and would push a frame at that address.

- **Acceptance:** boot prints `sscratch` in the CSR block and `sscratch 0`
  after install; `just test expect="CSR OK"` passes.

### T2.1 — Linker script: user sections, per-task stacks, guard holes — M
The regions in the table above, with per-task-index symbols. `MAX_TASKS` is
mirrored in Rust with a `const _: () = assert!` against the linker-derived
region count so the two cannot drift.

- **Acceptance:** `nm` shows each guard hole exactly 4 KiB, each stack 8 KiB,
  each break window 64 KiB, every user region 4 KiB-aligned, and
  `__heap_start` still immediately above `__kernel_end`; the kernel still
  boots to `M1 FUNDAMENTALS OK`.

### T2.2 — Map the user address space; verify `U` bits in software — M
Extend `page::build` with `LEAF_URX` / `LEAF_UR` / `LEAF_URW`. Today's
`flags_match` requires `U=0` on every probe; make the expected `U` bit a
per-probe field and probe every new region plus every guard hole.

- **Acceptance:** the printed walk shows `U=1` on user regions, `U=0` on
  kernel regions, and unmapped for every guard hole;
  `just test expect="PAGETABLE OK"` passes.

### T2.3 — Trap entry/exit rework — L
Fill D-0020 block 1 with the `sscratch` swap and the branch-on-zero
discrimination (D-0029); reload the kernel's `gp` on the U path; factor block 4
into a `__trap_return` symbol shared by the epilogue and the first U-mode
entry; change `trap_handler` to *return* the frame to resume (D-0032), which
costs block 4 one `mv sp, a0`.

- **Acceptance:** the whole existing suite still passes unchanged — every M1
  trap is a trap-from-S, so `just test`, `just test-panic`, `just test-hang`,
  and `just test-stress` exercise the S path and the `sscratch`-stays-zero
  invariant. The deliberate `ebreak` still reports and continues (`TRAP OK`).

### T2.4 — Task control block and the static task table — M
`Task { id, state: {Ready, Running, Exited}, frame, kstack_top, ustack_top,
brk_base, brk, brk_wall, exit_code }` in a static array. `create(id, entry)`
fabricates the initial frame (`sepc` = entry, `SPP`=0, `SPIE`=1,
`x[2]` = `ustack_top`, `gp` = `tp` = 0 per D-0032). No allocation anywhere in
this path.

- **Acceptance:** boot prints the table — ids, stack tops, break windows — and
  asserts `frame == kstack_top - 272` for every task.

### T2.5 — First U-mode entry — M
`sret` into task 0, whose body immediately `ecall`s back; the dispatcher
answers "not implemented" for now. Prints `USER OK`.

- **Acceptance:** `just test expect="USER OK"` passes. Separately,
  `just check-utext` (and `just objdump '-d --section=.utext'`) shows that
  every symbol referenced from `.utext` resolves inside the user sections
  (`.utext` / `.urodata` / `.udata` / `.ubss`) or a task's own stack/break
  window. `auipc+addi` and `lui+addi` that form such an address are
  legitimate — a real `write` needs a buffer in `.urodata`, and referencing
  it takes one of those pairs. A `lui`/`li` immediate used as a *value*
  (not a PC-relative symbol) is not a reference. The failure being guarded
  against is a reference into kernel `.text` or kernel `.rodata`, not a
  particular opcode. `gp`-/`tp`-relative access is still rejected: those
  bases are kernel-owned (D-0032). The old "no `auipc`" reading was only
  right while `write` was a stub and `a0 = 1` was never dereferenced.

### T2.6 — Syscall ABI and `ecall`-from-U dispatch — M
Dispatch on `EXC_ECALL_U` per D-0033: number in `a7`, arguments `a0`–`a5`,
return pair `a0` = error / `a1` = value, written **into the frame**.
`sepc += 4` with the no-`c.ecall` citation. An unknown number kills the task
(D-0034) rather than panicking the kernel. Prints `SYSCALL OK`.

- **Acceptance:** `just test expect="SYSCALL OK"` passes; a task calling
  number 99 is killed with a printed diagnostic and the system stays up.

### T2.7 — User-pointer validation and `SUM`-windowed copies — M
`user_range_ok(task, ptr, len)` against that task's static intervals
(overflow-checked, containment in user stack / live break / `.udata`+`.ubss` /
`.urodata` for read-only sources). No page-table walk. `copy_from_user` /
`copy_to_user` raise `SUM` only around an already-validated `memcpy`:
validate → raise SUM → memcpy → clear SUM. Per-call cap is 4 KiB; a longer
request returns a short count (`min(len, 4096)`), not an error. The same
answer is what T2.8 `write` must give. A range that starts valid but runs
past its interval is `ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS`, not a short copy of the prefix.

- **Acceptance:** `just test-userptr` passes. Each invalid-pointer shape
  is its own feature boot (`userptr-kernel-selftest`,
  `userptr-span-selftest`) so a kill cannot hide the other; both return
  `ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS` and kill the task (D-0034). The kernel neither
  faults nor panics. `SUM` is clear again on the next trap (asserted at
  dispatcher entry). The kernel address is built from immediates, not a
  symbol reference (`just check-utext`).

### T2.8 — The five syscalls — M (S each)
`write(ptr, len) -> count` (console only, no `fd`), `exit(code)`,
`sbrk(delta) -> old_break`, `gettime() -> raw counter`, `yield()`. Semantics
and error codes per D-0033. A task grows its break and uses the memory;
prints `SBRK OK`. `sbrk` past the wall **or** below `brk_base` returns
`NO_MEM` with the break unchanged. `yield` resumes the same task until T2.9.

- **Acceptance:** `just test expect="SBRK OK"` passes; `sbrk` past the wall
  returns `NO_MEM` and leaves the break unchanged; `gettime` deltas across a
  `write` are positive and smaller than a tick period. `just test-userptr`
  still kills both invalid-pointer shapes.

### T2.9 — Round-robin scheduler at trap exit — L
The timer handler ends the slice (slice = one tick, D-0035) and returns the
next `Ready` task's frame. `yield` does the same immediately. No idle loop:
with no blocking states the ready set is empty only when every task has
exited, which shuts down.

The demo tasks make the test deterministic rather than timing-dependent: each
spins on `gettime` until **its own** observed counter has advanced by
`2 × PERIOD` (20 ms at 10 MHz), printing a progress line every 5 ms, then
exits. Because `rdtime` is wall-clock at a fixed 10 MHz, a task that refuses
to exit before 20 ms of counter advance is preempted at least twice at a 10 ms
tick on any host, and a slower host produces *more* switches, never fewer.

The kernel asserts the property itself and panics with the counts if it fails:
both tasks `Exited`, `yields == 0` for both, and at least one switch in each
direction. Then it prints, before `SCHED OK`:

```
task 1 done writes=4 yields=0
task 2 done writes=4 yields=0
sched switches 1->2=3 2->1=2 yields=0
```

- **Acceptance:** `just test expect="SCHED OK"` passes, and the recipe also
  greps the serial log for all four of:
  `task 1 done writes=[0-9]* yields=0`, `task 2 done writes=[0-9]* yields=0`,
  `sched switches 1->2=[1-9]`, `2->1=[1-9]`; plus an `awk` check that the
  first `^task 2 ` line precedes the `^task 1 done` line. Exact interleaving
  is never asserted.

### T2.10 — Contained user faults — M
A U-mode page fault, misaligned instruction address, or bad syscall kills the
task with `task N killed: <cause> sepc=… stval=…` and reschedules. New
`user-fault-selftest` feature and `just test-user-fault`, in the same shape as
`panic-selftest` and `frame-exhaust-selftest`.

- **Acceptance:** `just test-user-fault` shows the faulting task killed, the
  other task continuing to completion, and a clean shutdown — the kernel does
  **not** panic and the recipe expects exit 0, not the inverted status the
  panic recipes use.

### T2.11 — Freeze the frame allocator — S
`frame::freeze()` immediately before the first `sret` to U (D-0036). After it,
`alloc_frame` / `free_frame` panic printing the request. Enforces by assertion
what T2.1/T2.8 arrange by construction: nothing in the trap path allocates.

- **Acceptance:** boot prints `frames frozen: free=N`; a deliberate
  `alloc_frame` after freeze panics with that message. `just test-stress`
  still passes (the storm runs before the freeze).

### T2.12 — Two demo tasks and milestone wrap — M
Two counters writing at different rates, one of them using `sbrk`, both
exiting; the last `exit` shuts down. Marker `M2 EXECUTION OK`, harness default
updated, GLOSSARY and DECISIONS updated.

- **Acceptance:** `just test` (no arguments) passes on the new default marker.

prints `TEST PASS: found "M2 EXECUTION OK"` and exits 0, and the serial log
from `just run` contains, in order: the M1 markers, `frames frozen`,
`USER OK`, `SYSCALL OK`, `SBRK OK`, the two tasks' progress lines (and the
sbrk-backed write), both `task N exit 0` lines, both `task N done … yields=0`
lines, the `sched switches` line, `SCHED OK`, `M2 EXECUTION OK`, then a clean
exit 0.
`just test-panic`, `just test-hang`, `just test-stress`, `just test-userptr`,
`just test-user-fault`, and `just test-freeze` all still hold their verdicts.

## M2 summary

**Produced:** an S-mode kernel that `sret`s into U-mode tasks over a 5-syscall
ABI, copies user pointers through a `SUM` window after a static-interval
check, round-robins on every tick (`mv sp, a0` is the switch), kills a
delegated U-mode fault without panicking, and freezes the frame allocator
before the first `sret` so the trap path cannot allocate. Two demo tasks
write at different rates; task 2 grows its break and uses the memory; the
last `exit` shuts the machine down. Containment does not cover undelegated
causes (illegal instruction → OpenSBI).

**Acceptance proves:** `just test` finds `M2 EXECUTION OK` and exits 0.
`just run` prints the M1 markers, then `frames frozen`, `USER OK`,
`SYSCALL OK`, `SBRK OK`, interleaved progress with `yields=0`, both
`task N exit 0` lines, `SCHED OK`, `M2 EXECUTION OK`, and QEMU exits 0.
Sibling selftests keep their verdicts.

**Decisions this milestone:** D-0029 `sscratch` protocol; D-0030 static
per-task stacks with guard holes; D-0031 user map built before `satp`, no
PTE edits after; D-0032 switch at trap exit, the trap frame *is* the task
context; D-0033 syscall ABI; D-0034 user-pointer validation, `SUM` window,
user faults kill the task (delegated subset only); D-0035 slice = one tick,
no idle loop, known fairness of `SIE=0` in S; D-0036 D-0028 resolved by
preallocation plus `frame::freeze()`.

## Risks and likely failure modes

- **T2.3, `gp` clobber.** A trap from U arrives with the user's `gp`; relaxed
  kernel static accesses inside the handler then read the wrong addresses.
  Symptom is impossible static values far from the cause, not a fault.
- **T2.3, `sscratch` nonzero while in S-mode.** Any window where `sscratch`
  is nonzero during S-mode execution turns a kernel exception into a
  frame-clobbering mess. D-0029 shrinks that window to the single `csrrw`
  immediately before `sret`, which touches no memory and cannot fault.
- **T2.5, wrong side of the `U` bit.** User code in a `U=0` page is an
  instruction page fault at the task's first instruction (cause 12,
  `sepc` = the entry point). The same mistake reaches further than expected:
  a string literal left in kernel `.rodata` faults on the task's *load*, and a
  compiler-emitted `memcpy` call into kernel `.text` faults on the *fetch*.
- **T2.6, `sepc` not advanced before a switch.** If a syscall reschedules and
  the advance happens after, the task re-executes its `ecall` on resume — an
  infinite syscall loop that presents as a hang.
- **T2.7, `SUM` left set.** A `SUM` window spanning anything but the validated
  `memcpy` is ambient authority over user memory inside kernel code. Raise it
  after validation, drop it before any formatting or dispatch.
- **`sstatus.FS` is likely `Off`.** An FP instruction from U-mode is then an
  illegal instruction, and code 2 is **not delegated** on this platform
  (M1 concept 9): OpenSBI dumps it and our handler never sees it. Demo tasks
  stay integer-only; check the boot `sstatus` snapshot before blaming the
  scheduler.
- **Kernel stack overflow is a silent hang, not a fault report.** 8 KiB per
  task, a debug build, and `println!` formatting on the nested-panic path.
  See concept 10 and D-0030; the signature is in DEBUGGING.md §4.
- **A pending timer during a syscall is not a lost tick** (concept 3).
  Preemption lands right after the `sret`; that is the design, not a bug.

# M3 — Unikernel

**Goal:** the kernel-defined demo tasks are replaced by a single application
crate compiled into the image, running as the sole U-mode task. A hand-rolled
virtio-net driver and a hand-rolled network stack — Ethernet, ARP, IPv4, ICMP
echo, UDP echo, and enough TCP to serve one HTTP response to a real client —
carry every byte of the path. **No smoltcp, no third-party stack, no TLS.**
Every design choice serves M4's headline measurement: boot-to-first-HTTP-byte,
decomposed phase by phase, against minimal Linux and Unikraft under identical
conditions. The boot path is an optimization target after correctness.

**Decisions recorded before any code:** D-0037 hand-rolled stack and the TCP
scope tripwire; D-0038 modern virtio-mmio, split virtqueue, static DMA pool
(freeze stands); D-0039 MMIO window mapped at build (amends D-0025, D-0031
intact); D-0040 driver and stack in the kernel, `recv`/`send` syscalls,
polling, no PLIC; D-0041 minimal TCP; D-0042 static network config, no DHCP;
D-0043 measurement edges, `fast-boot` profile, capture in the harness;
D-0044 app-crate placement and the check-utext FP ban.

**Scope tripwire:** any TCP work beyond "serves one GET to curl, verified in
a capture" requires M4 to already have first numbers. No retransmission
tuning, no multiple connections, no feature past the demo until measurement
exists. M3 ends at T3.12; TCP polish is not a task that exists.

## Prerequisite concepts

**1. A split virtqueue is three structures we own in guest RAM.** A
descriptor table (16 bytes per entry: `addr` u64, `len` u32, `flags` u16,
`next` u16), an avail ring (driver→device: `flags`, `idx`, `ring[N]` of
descriptor heads), and a used ring (device→driver: `idx`, `ring[N]` of
`{id, len}`). The driver writes descriptors, appends the head to
`avail.ring`, increments `avail.idx`, and writes the queue number to the
`QueueNotify` register. The device consumes buffers and bumps `used.idx`.
Every address handed over is guest-physical — the identity map (D-0006)
makes `&static as usize` the physical address, which is the quiet payoff
of VA = PA here.

**2. The device-status handshake has exactly one loud failure point.**
Init is: reset (`Status=0`, read back 0) → `ACKNOWLEDGE` → `DRIVER` → read
device features → write driver features → `FEATURES_OK` → **read back and
verify FEATURES_OK is still set** — a device that cannot live with our
feature set clears it, and this readback is the only place the handshake
tells us so — then per-queue setup, then `DRIVER_OK`. QEMU's virtio-mmio
defaults to legacy (version 1); we force modern (version 2) with
`-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false` and negotiate `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1`
(bit 32) plus `VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC` (bit 5) and nothing else. Without
`MRG_RXBUF` the virtio-net header is a fixed 12 bytes and every RX buffer
must hold a whole frame: 2048-byte buffers, single-descriptor chains, no
chaining logic at all.

**3. Memory barriers are correctness we cannot test.** RISC-V is weakly
ordered: the device must not observe `avail.idx` before the descriptor
writes, so `fence w,w` precedes the idx store, `fence w,o` precedes the
`QueueNotify` MMIO store, and `fence r,r` sits between reading `used.idx`
and reading the ring entry. QEMU's device model runs synchronously enough
to hide a missing fence, which makes it the worst kind of bug — latent on
real hardware, unprovokable on our only platform. The fences go in on day
one precisely because their absence cannot be tested.

**4. Our TCP peer is libslirp, not the host kernel.** Under `-netdev user`,
slirp NATs: the guest is 10.0.2.15, the gateway 10.0.2.2, and a `hostfwd`
TCP connection is *terminated* by slirp on the host side and re-originated
toward us from 10.0.2.2. curl's kernel-grade TCP (SACK, timestamps, window
scaling) never reaches us; slirp sends an MSS option and little else. This
de-risks TCP and slightly weakens the "real client" claim — the pcap is the
arbiter, and tap networking is the recorded M4 escape hatch if a hostile
peer is ever needed. Inbound ICMP echo is unroutable under user-net, so
ICMP is exercised guest→out (we ping 10.0.2.2; slirp answers).

**5. The Internet checksum is the one place endianness does not bite.**
One's-complement sum of 16-bit words is byte-order-immune if summed
consistently and carry-folded until stable — worth a comment, because "why
doesn't this need swapping" is the follow-up question. Everything else
does bite: multi-byte fields cross the wire boundary only through
`from_be_bytes`/`to_be_bytes` at parse/serialize sites, never via struct
overlay of packet memory. UDP and TCP checksums include the pseudo-header;
UDP's "0 means no checksum, send 0xFFFF if the sum is 0" wrinkle applies.

**6. Minimum TCP machinery, and what naive stacks get wrong.** Honor the
data-offset field on every segment (assuming 20-byte headers shears the
moment a peer sends any option — we parse MSS from the SYN and skip the
rest via data offset). Sequence arithmetic is mod 2³². SYN and FIN each
consume one sequence number — the off-by-one there produces
"connection hangs at close" symptoms that look like retransmit bugs.
Anything unexpected gets RST plus a counter, never silence, never a panic.

**7. "DMA" in QEMU is a memcpy by the device model.** There is no IOMMU on
`virt`; the device reads whatever guest-physical addresses we put in
descriptors. Buffers must be physically contiguous — statics are, by
construction. The flip side: a corrupt descriptor address makes the device
write anywhere in guest RAM, which is why `virtq::verify()` checks every
descriptor address against the pool before `DRIVER_OK`.

**8. Measurement edges must be named before they are argued about.**
E0 = host clock at QEMU exec; E1 = machine start (`mtime` ≈ 0); E2 = kernel
entry (`rdtime` at `_start` is the OpenSBI phase — T3.12 measured the
reset-time offset as 0); E3g = `rdtime` when the response segment's TX
descriptor is published; E3w = pcap timestamp of that frame; E4 = first
byte at the client. E0→E4 is the honest number and the comparable number;
E2→E3g decomposed by phase is the floor number. First-byte requires a
request, so the client runs a tight retry loop started before E0 —
bounded jitter, reported alongside boot-to-ready (E0 → first successful
connect).

## Memory map additions (M3)

| Region | VA = PA | Perms | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| virtio-mmio window | `0x1000_1000..0x1000_9000` | R + W (never X, U=0) | 8 transports, 0x1000 stride (QEMU `hw/riscv/virt.c`); mapped in `page::build` before `activate` — D-0031's ban on post-activation edits stands (D-0039) |
| DMA pool | kernel `.bss` statics | R + W (existing map) | RX 16×2048 B + TX 8×2048 B + rings, `#[repr(align(4096))]`; the frame allocator is never touched — freeze stands (D-0038) |

### T3.0 — Decisions and plan — S
D-0037 through D-0044 in DECISIONS.md; this section in PLAN.md; tshark and
the QEMU flags into SETUP.md / `scripts/install.sh`.

- **Acceptance:** entries exist; sign-off recorded; no code changed.

### T3.1 — MMIO window and transport discovery — M
Map the 8-page virtio-mmio window in `page::build` (map-then-probe: discovery
itself needs a mapped page to read the magic register). After `activate`,
probe all 8 slots: magic `0x74726976`, version, device ID. Print a table;
panic if no network device (fail loudly — a netless boot is a misconfigured
harness, not a degraded mode). The T2.2-style verify walk grows assertions
for the window (mapped, R+W, U=0, non-X). All QEMU invocations in the
harness gain the NIC flags so feature images do not diverge from the
default boot.

- **Acceptance:** boot prints the transport table with the net device's slot
  and version 2; `just test` and every sibling selftest still hold with the
  new flags.

### T3.2 — Static DMA pool, virtqueue structs, and `virtq::verify()` — M
Rings and buffers as page-aligned statics in kernel `.bss` (concept 1,
D-0038). `virtq::verify()` is the T1.6 move replayed: before `DRIVER_OK`,
assert descriptor/avail/used alignment (16/2/4), every `desc[i].addr` inside
the pool, every address identity-mapped (through the existing walker),
`avail.idx == used.idx == 0`, and **read back** the six queue-address
registers and compare against what we wrote — the readback catches the
silent killers (wrong offset, swapped high/low word) at init instead of as
a dead ring.

- **Acceptance:** `verify()` passes on boot; `frames frozen: free=N` is
  unchanged from M2 (the pool took nothing from the allocator).

### T3.3 — virtio-net init to `DRIVER_OK` — M
The concept-2 handshake. Negotiate `VERSION_1 | NET_F_MAC` only; verify the
FEATURES_OK readback; check `QueueNumMax >= 16` per queue; RX = queue 0,
TX = queue 1; post all 16 RX buffers; print the MAC from config space.
Observability lands here, not later: `net::dump()` prints Status,
InterruptStatus, both rings' shadow indices, and the posted/completed
counters; a stall detector (TX posted, `used.idx` unmoved for ~100 ms of
`rdtime`) prints the dump once, without panicking.

- **Acceptance:** boot reaches `DRIVER_OK` with status read back; MAC
  printed; `just test-net-init` (feature selftest, sibling shape) passes.

### T3.4 — TX path: first packet on the wire — M
Build and transmit a gratuitous ARP for 10.0.2.15 at driver init. The
harness gains `-object filter-dump,id=f0,netdev=net0,file=whimbrel.pcap`
from this task onward — capture is standing infrastructure, not a debugging
afterthought (D-0043).

- **Acceptance:** the gratuitous ARP is present in the pcap (tshark
  assertion in-script); TX counters show posted == completed == 1.

### T3.5 — RX path: first packet received — M
Poll the used ring; a host-side TCP connect attempt to the hostfwd port
makes slirp emit an ARP request for 10.0.2.15 — that is the trigger, no
guest-side code needed to provoke it. Consumed RX buffers are re-posted,
never freed (the pool cycles; there is no buffer allocation path).

- **Acceptance:** RX counter increments and the frame is classified as ARP
  (printed); pcap shows slirp's request.

### T3.6 — ARP: parse, reply, cache — S
Reply to requests for our IP; 4-entry cache with wraparound eviction (slirp
needs one entry — the gateway — but a fixed array is the same code as one
entry and does not lie about being a cache). Drop-with-counter for
everything else (concept 6's rule applied down-stack: remote bytes are user
input, D-0040).

- **Acceptance:** pcap shows request → our reply; a subsequent hostfwd
  connect proceeds past ARP (slirp learns us).

### T3.7 — IPv4 and ICMP echo — M
IPv4 parse: version/IHL check, **verify the header checksum on RX** (ten
lines; skipping it because slirp is well-formed is the dishonest skip),
honor IHL rather than assuming 20,
drop fragments (MF or offset ≠ 0) with a counter. No routing: everything
TX goes to the gateway MAC. ICMP echo reply (type 8 → 0) plus a
guest-initiated ping of 10.0.2.2 as the testable direction (concept 4).

- **Acceptance:** guest prints the ping RTT from 10.0.2.2; pcap shows our
  request and slirp's reply; malformed-packet counters exist and read 0 on
  the happy path.

### T3.8 — UDP echo — M
UDP parse/build with pseudo-header checksum; echo server on a fixed port
over `hostfwd=udp::7777-:7`.

- **Acceptance:** `just test-net-udp`: `nc -u` from the host, payload
  echoed back verbatim, asserted in-script.

### T3.9 — App crate, `recv`/`send` syscalls, check-utext evolution — L
The app becomes a real crate linked into the user sections: linker script
matches the app archive's `.text/.rodata/.data/.bss` into
`.utext/.urodata/.udata/.ubss`; `usys` wraps the syscalls. New syscalls
`recv` (6) and `send` (7) per D-0040 — `recv(buf, len) → (err, n)` returns
request payload or `EAGAIN`, **and each `recv` call is what polls the NIC
and advances the stack**; `send(buf, len, flags)` transmits, FIN flag bit
closes. D-0035 survives: no Blocked state — a task waiting for a packet is
running, spinning on `recv`. check-utext grows to handle compiled-Rust
output, and **rejects every FP mnemonic including the compressed forms**
(`c.fld`, `c.fsd`, `c.fldsp`, `c.fsdsp` — the ones a compiler emits
silently and a naive list misses; D-0044). FS stays Off: an FP instruction
in `.utext` would be an undelegated illegal instruction (the M2 known
limit), so it is made unrepresentable instead.

- **Acceptance:** the T3.8 UDP echo moves into the app over `recv`/`send`
  and still passes; `just check-utext` passes on the compiled app and fails
  on a planted `c.fld`; `just test-userptr` / `test-user-fault` verdicts
  hold with the new syscall numbers.

### T3.10 — TCP passive open — L
LISTEN → SYN_RCVD → ESTABLISHED, one listener, one connection. Parse MSS
from the SYN, skip all other options via data offset. Duplicate SYN in
SYN_RCVD re-sends the SYN/ACK (the handshake is self-healing without a
timer: the peer retransmits SYNs). ISN from `rdtime` low bits.
Checksums with pseudo-header both directions — a wrong TX checksum is a
silently discarded segment, i.e. a hung curl with nothing on serial, which
is why the pcap workflow (T3.4) predates TCP.

- **Acceptance (checkpoint, demonstrable alone):** pcap shows
  SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK; ESTABLISHED counter set; no RST.

### T3.11 — TCP data, close, retransmit; the HTTP demo — L
In-order data surfaced through `recv`; the app parses the request line and
`send`s `HTTP/1.0 200 OK` + fixed body + FIN flag. Stop-and-wait: at most
one unacked data segment in flight, fixed 200 ms `rdtime` RTO checked from
the polling loop, 8 attempts then RST (D-0041 — the failure symptom
without retransmit is curl hanging forever with nothing on serial, the
single worst debugging experience available in this project). Close:
FIN_WAIT_1 → FIN_WAIT_2 → truncated TIME_WAIT (log, drop to CLOSED;
a retransmitted peer FIN meets RST — visible in the capture, harmless for
a one-shot server). CLOSE_WAIT → LAST_ACK for the peer-closes-first race.
FIN consumes a sequence number (concept 6). A feature-gated
drop-first-TX selftest provokes the retransmit path once to prove the
timer fires.

- **Acceptance:** `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/` returns 200 with the exact
  body; pcap shows the full exchange with a clean FIN close and no RST on
  the happy path; the retransmit selftest shows exactly one retransmission
  and then success.

### T3.12 — Measurement instrumentation, standalone boot, wrap — M
Six parts.
**(a) Validate E2 before using it:** freeze the machine at reset
(`just measure-e2` / `just debug`), read `time` via GDB before the first
guest instruction, record the observed offset; `rdtime` at `_start` minus
that offset is the OpenSBI phase. The observed offset is recorded in
D-0043 — the firmware row of the M4 table rests on this being measured,
not assumed.
**(b) Phase timestamps:** `rdtime` into a static array at `_start`, `stvec`
installed, paging on, freeze, first `sret`, `DRIVER_OK`, first RX,
listen-ready, first-response-TX (E3g); printed **after** the response is
sent (DBCN is one `ecall` per byte; printing on the measured path would
perturb it).
**(c) Standalone boot:** ARP *for* the gateway `10.0.2.2` at init and wait
for the reply, rather than waiting to be asked. Removes the hostfwd-watcher
boot dependency and exercises the ARP client path. D-0047's empty-cache
panic then means a real resolution failure (D-0054).
**(d) `just run-http`:** boots the persist HTTP image with hostfwd, resolves
the gateway, listens, and sits indefinitely — no assertions, no timeout —
so `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/` works from a cold boot with nothing else
running. Every just recipe gets a single-line doc comment (`just --list`
shows the last comment line).
**(e) `fast-boot` cargo feature** (same codebase, sibling-feature shape):
removes the boot tick wait, compiles out self-tests and non-essential
prints, keeps the panic path, the phase array, **and the map verify** —
the safe/fast delta is reported as the price-of-paranoia finding (D-0043).
The M1 timer acceptance does not get orphaned: the default profile's
30-tick wait shrinks to 3 ticks with `tick 3` still on serial as the
timer assertion's new home, and timer coverage additionally holds
structurally — round-robin preemption (the T2.9 switch counters) cannot
happen without live ticks. The panic path clears `sie.STIE` so a parked
hart does not print ticks forever.
**(f) Wrap:** `M3 UNIKERNEL OK` marker after the first served response in
the default boot; `just test` default flips to it; GLOSSARY (virtqueue,
slirp, checksum, RTO, E0–E4, fast-boot, GARP, hostfwd, …) and DECISIONS
catch-up; M3 summary in this file.

- **Acceptance:** `just test` (no arguments) passes on `M3 UNIKERNEL OK`;
  boot prints the phase-timestamp block after the response; `just run-http`
  plus curl works with nothing else running; `just test-fast` reports the
  debug fast-boot phase block; `just test-fast-release` reports the
  release+fast-boot block with a client retrying before E0 (D-0043);
  `just test-net-init` and `just test-net-tcp` assert gateway ARP then
  handshake, not slirp-asked-first; every sibling selftest holds.

## Milestone acceptance test

```
$ just test-net
```
boots with `-netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80,hostfwd=udp::7777-:7
-device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 -global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false`
plus `filter-dump`, runs a curl retry loop, and asserts: HTTP 200 with the
exact expected body; a pcap containing the gratuitous ARP, the handshake,
the response, and a clean FIN exchange with no RST on the happy path.
`just test` passes on `M3 UNIKERNEL OK`. `just test-panic`, `test-hang`,
`test-stress`, `test-userptr`, `test-user-fault`, `test-freeze`,
`test-net-init`, `test-net-tcp`, `test-net-udp`, `test-net-http`,
`test-net-rto`, `test-fast`, and `test-fast-release` all hold their
verdicts. `just run-http` serves curl from a cold boot with nothing else
running.

## M3 summary

**Produced:** a unikernel that ARPs for `10.0.2.2`, listens on TCP/80, and
serves one HTTP/1.0 GET (`whimbrel\n`, `Connection: close`, FIN close) to
curl on the hostfwd port. The driver is virtio-mmio modern, split
virtqueue, static DMA pool, freeze intact. The stack is Ethernet, ARP
(server and client), IPv4, ICMP echo, UDP echo, and one-TCB TCP with a
200 ms RTO. The app is compiled Rust in `.utext` over `recv`/`send`.
Phase timestamps from `_start` to E3g print after the response. E2 offset
is 0. `fast-boot` drops the tick wait and self-tests but keeps map verify.
M4 cites release+fast-boot with a client retrying before E0; debug paging
is opt-level=0, not the cost of paging (D-0043). Handshake siblings
(`test-net-init`, `test-net-tcp`) connect after the gateway MAC is
learned; slirp-asked-first asserts are retired as live gates.

**Acceptance proves:** `just test` finds `M3 UNIKERNEL OK` and exits 0.
Curl returns 200 with the exact body. The pcap shows our ARP request for
the gateway, slirp's reply, the handshake, the response, and a clean FIN
close with no RST. `just run-http` works standalone. Sibling selftests
keep their verdicts.

**Decisions this milestone:** D-0037 hand-rolled stack and the TCP
tripwire; D-0038 modern virtio-mmio, split virtqueue, static DMA pool;
D-0039 MMIO window mapped at build; D-0040 driver and stack in the
kernel, `recv`/`send`, polling, no PLIC; D-0041 minimal TCP; D-0042
static config, no DHCP; D-0043 measurement edges, `fast-boot`, capture;
D-0044 app crate and the check-utext FP ban; D-0045–D-0054 along the
bring-up (GARP, slirp ARP, ARP cache, ICMP, UDP, TCP, HTTP, gateway ARP
at init).

## Risks and likely failure modes

- **The device does nothing — no trap, no fault, no log line.** The
  debugging ladder, in order: Status register readback → `net::dump()`
  counters (did `used.idx` ever move?) → `-d guest_errors` (DMA into
  unmapped guest-physical addresses — the identity-typo class) → is the
  pcap empty? → ring readback. Built in T3.2/T3.3, before the first bug.
- **A missing barrier cannot be provoked in QEMU** (concept 3). The fences
  are written from day one and reviewed against the spec, because no test
  here can fail on their absence.
- **A wrong TCP/UDP checksum is a silently discarded segment.** Symptom:
  hung curl, clean serial. First response: read the pcap, not the code.
- **check-utext explodes on compiled Rust.** The app crate multiplies the
  instruction forms in `.utext`; the checker either grows handlers or
  fails closed (its design). Budgeted inside T3.9's L, and the FP ban
  (including compressed forms) lands in the same pass.
- **An FP instruction in `.utext` is an undelegated illegal instruction** —
  OpenSBI dump, hart parked, no kill line (M2's known limit). Made
  unrepresentable by the check-utext ban rather than handled at runtime.
- **Slirp-as-peer weakens the "real client" claim.** Recorded in D-0042;
  the pcap is the arbiter of protocol correctness; tap networking is the
  M4 threat-to-validity escape hatch.
- **Unikraft's riscv64 port is an open PR, not mainline.** The M4
  comparison rests on a feasibility spike (timeboxed, at the M3/M4
  boundary) with a recorded fallback ladder (D-0043): full three-way →
  different-ISA reference → two-way plus qualitative analysis.
- **Removing the 300 ms tick wait silently deletes timer coverage** unless
  its assertion moves — T3.12(c) keeps `tick 3` in the default profile and
  notes the structural coverage via preemption counters.
- **`rdtime` at `_start` ≈ OpenSBI cost is an assumption** until T3.12(a)
  measures the reset-time `mtime` offset. Validated before any M4 number
  cites it.

# M4 — Evaluation

**Goal:** the flagship result is **boot-to-first-HTTP-byte, three ways under
identical conditions** — Whimbrel, minimal Linux (buildroot + a static-C
accept-loop server as PID 1), and Unikraft's HTTP example via the riscv64
PR with the recorded fallback ladder (D-0043). Framed as **floor-finding**:
the minimum structurally necessary time from kernel entry to first HTTP
byte, decomposed phase by phase, with the milliseconds a general-purpose OS
spends that a single-purpose VM doesn't shown by measurement, not
assertion. Deliverables: a benchmark harness producing raw CSV plus summary
statistics, and a technical report. **The report is the artifact; the
kernel is the apparatus.**

**Decisions recorded before any code:** D-0055 (methodology freeze and
harness architecture), D-0056 (pre-baseline corrections), D-0057
(attribution stamps and phase renames), D-0058 (optimization-ladder
governance), D-0059 (2 MiB superpages; amends D-0026), D-0060 (O(1) frame
accounting), D-0061 (`-bios none` charter; scoped amendment to D-0003),
D-0062 (Linux baseline), D-0063 (Unikraft spike), D-0064 (report, claims
discipline, convergence gate, audits). Subsequent M4 entries:
D-0065 (bump/lazy), D-0066 (E3w→E4 remainder), D-0067 (per-batch
result files), D-0068 (PHASE dump must not sit on publish→E4),
D-0069 (pre-registration underestimates small-phase costs). The
pre-M4 whole-tree
audit is `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`; task text below cites its findings by
number.

**Standing structural rules for the milestone:**
- **Methodology freezes before any optimization.** No rung lands until the
  harness produces a stable baseline table (stability is numeric, D-0055)
  on the dedicated Ubuntu host in SETUP.md. **T4.3 freeze:** measured
  kernel `35861f3`; CSV freeze tag `baseline-t4.3`. T4.2 KVM-pod stamps
  are ladder-ordering only, not report numbers. Every before/after claim
  cites this baseline.
  Pre-baseline corrections (T4.0b) and instrumentation (T4.2) were exempt
  from the no-optimization rule but not from the full gate list.
- **Draft-early.** The report skeleton is written with real numbers as soon
  as the baseline table exists; all later work edits the draft. Exhibit
  tables are generated from CSV by script, never typed, so prose cannot
  drift from data. After T4.4 the generator reads the freeze from tag
  `baseline-t4.3` and the after-ladder from a named T4.6 CSV commit
  (D-0067).
- **Convergence gate.** M4 is done when the checklist at the end of this
  section is fully checked — an open-ended timeline must not become an
  unfinished one.
- **Git:** all M4 work on branch `m4-evaluation`; push to that branch only;
  never to `main`.

## Prerequisite concepts

**1. Median and minimum answer different questions.** Measurement noise on
this platform (host scheduling, TCG translation, slirp) is one-sided
additive: it can make a run slower, never faster. So the minimum over N
trials approaches the floor, while the median is the robust comparison
statistic — an order statistic like min improves with N and is unfair
across systems with different noise profiles. The report uses median/IQR
for every comparison and before/after claim, shows min as the observed
floor bound, and never uses means: a single descheduled run poisons a mean
invisibly.

**2. TCG time is not hardware time.** QEMU translates guest code;
compute-dense phases (a 32k-entry page-table build) are taxed differently
than I/O-dense phases (MMIO round trips into the device model). Ratios
between phases would differ on silicon. Every claim carries "under QEMU
TCG" conditions; this is threat-to-validity #1, stated in the abstract,
not buried.

**3. Guest-internal clocks vs. host-observed edges.** `rdtime` phase
stamps decompose Whimbrel's boot at 100 ns resolution but exist only for
Whimbrel. Linux printk timestamps and Unikraft's boot instrumentation are
different instruments with different observation costs. Cross-system
*comparisons* therefore ride only on host/client-observed edges
(E0 → first-connect, E0 → E4) that need zero guest cooperation and are
defined identically for all systems. Decompositions are per-system
exhibits, labeled with their instrument.

**4. The client is part of the apparatus.** First-byte requires a request,
so the client retry loop (started before E0, D-0043) bounds E4 from above
by its retry granularity. A fork-per-attempt curl loop has multi-ms exec
overhead (audit finding 32); the measurement client must be a persistent
process stamping a monotonic clock, and its measured granularity goes in
threats-to-validity.

**5. A superpage is a leaf at a higher level.** Sv39 lets a level-1 PTE
with any of R/W/X set map 2 MiB; the PPN's low 9 bits must be zero or the
walk faults (misaligned superpage). Mixed granularity means two leaf
levels coexist, so a verifier must know which level each region is
*supposed* to resolve at — a walk that accepts any level would bless
exactly the failure D-0026 warned about.

**6. What `-bios none` removes and what it obligates.** Without OpenSBI we
enter at 0x8000_0000 in M-mode and inherit firmware's duties: PMP (QEMU
implements PMP, so with no entry programmed every S/U access fails — the
classic silent-boot footgun), `medeleg`/`mideleg`, `mcounteren.TM`
(without it every `rdtime` in S-mode is an illegal instruction), and timer
plumbing. With `menvcfg.STCE` (Sstc) set by our own M-mode boot code,
S-mode arms `stimecmp` directly and M-mode needs no resident trap handler
at all — the shim becomes pure boot code, and D-0018's one-site timer seam
is the prepared landing spot.

## Tasks

### T4.0 — Decisions and plan — S
D-0055 through D-0064 in DECISIONS.md; this section in PLAN.md; the audit
findings into `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`; the stale milestone-table rows
fixed (audit finding 16).

- **Acceptance:** entries exist; sign-off recorded; docs only, no code.

### T4.0b — Pre-baseline corrections — M
Four audit findings whose fixes must precede any measurement, because
each changes what the baseline would mean (D-0056):
**(a) Fail-closed harness (finding 31):** `scripts/boot-test.sh` gets
`set -euo pipefail` from line 1 (with deliberate `set +e` islands where
exit codes are inspected); the build-failure mode is exercised once per
the DEBUGGING.md §4 item 8 rule — a broken build must produce FAIL, not a
stale-kernel PASS.
**(b) E3g at publish (finding 9):** the E3g stamp moves between `post_tx`
and `virtq::notify`, matching D-0043's definition; a second stamp
`E3g_doorbell` lands after the notify store returns, so the synchronous
device-model handoff is measured as its own line instead of silently
absorbed. Harness phase lists (finding 26) co-edited.
**(c) Spin, don't `wfi`, in boot RX waits (finding 12):** the `wfi`s in
`wait_gateway_arp` / `wait_ping_reply` are removed in all profiles (one
code path, D-0014), un-quantizing ARP/ping latency from the 10 ms tick.
Finding 13's corollary is recorded in D-0056: ticks were load-bearing for
those waits, and any future tick-removal rung is legal only because the
waits no longer sleep.
**(d) Buffer-size construction (finding 36):** the app exports its recv
buffer sizes; kernel `const _` asserts tie them to `tcp::PAYLOAD_MAX` and
`net::UDP_PAYLOAD_MAX` (the UDP image's buffer grows to match), so recv
truncation-by-coincidence becomes unrepresentable.

- **Acceptance:** a deliberately broken build makes every gate FAIL loudly;
  full gate list green after; `just test-fast` shows the new `E3g` /
  `E3g_doorbell` pair with plausible ordering; the const asserts reject a
  deliberately shrunk buffer at compile time.

### T4.1 — Benchmark harness — M
`scripts/bench.sh` (surfaced as `just bench-*`): runs N trials of a named
(system, config) pair; per trial: stamps E0 with a monotonic clock
immediately before QEMU exec, runs the persistent measurement client
(connect-retry from before E0; records first-connect and first-byte
stamps and attempt counts), captures serial and pcap, parses `PHASE` lines
into rows. Emits `results/runs.csv` (one row per trial: identity, host
metadata, E0-anchored edges) and `results/phases.csv` (one row per
trial × phase). A summary script computes n/median/IQR/min/max per metric.
Pinning is enforced fail-loudly: QEMU version + binary hash, whimbrel SHA
+ dirty flag, host kernel, CPU model, governor, load average recorded per
batch; the harness refuses to aggregate rows with mismatched QEMU version
or a dirty tree. QEMU and client are `taskset`-pinned to separate cores.
Warmup: first 3 trials of each config in a batch are marked and
excluded by the summarizer (round-robin, then shuffled recorded
trials). Every failure mode of every new assert is exercised once
(missing tshark, malformed PHASE line, zero-trial CSV). **Finding 14 is
settled here with a number:** one A/B batch, release+fast-boot with and
without `-C force-frame-pointers=yes`; deltas inside the floor (E2→E3g
Δ +0.250 ms, E0→E4 Δ +0.078 ms) and `.text` −15%, so the flag is
stripped from release and kept for debug via `scripts/cargo-debug.sh`.
Each trial records `/proc/stat` steal. Stability compares two
interleaved batches, not the two arms inside one batch; the bar is not
widened.

- **Acceptance:** `just bench-whimbrel` produces both CSVs and the summary
  for release-default ("safe") and release+fast-boot configs; two
  interleaved 30-trial batches meet the stability criterion (per-metric
  medians within max(2%, 200 µs) for all metrics ≥ 1 ms); the fail-closed
  checks demonstrably fail; the frame-pointer decision is recorded with
  its measured delta.

### T4.2 — Attribution stamps and phase renames — M
The stamp set becomes the audit's finding-3/5/6/7/9 decomposition,
verbatim (D-0057): `frame_init`, `task_init`, `page_build`, `page_verify`
split out of "paging"; the `satp` switch is stamped `activate`; `virtq_init`
split out of the DRIVER_OK delta; `serving_ready` stamped when the
gateway MAC is learned (the true earliest-serve point, finding 6);
`LISTEN` renamed `net_init_done` (what it is); `heap_init` and
`accounting` split out of the freeze delta (finding 7); `syn_rx` and
`established` split the E3g tail into external arrival vs. kernel serve
time (finding 9). Stamp overhead is measured by two adjacent stamps at
boot and reported. Harness co-edits per finding 26: the three justfile
phase lists and `phase.rs` N/NAMES move in the same commit.

- **Acceptance:** all gates green; phase rows sum to E2→E3g within the
  measured stamp overhead; `PHASE` output parses in the T4.1 harness;
  the finding-10 inventory and finding-12 prediction are checked against
  the first attributed table and the agreement or disagreement is
  recorded (finding 12: overtaken-by-fix, D-0056.3; finding 10: see
  D-0057). Ladder order after attribution: `frame_init`, then
  `accounting`, then `page_verify`; superpages re-evaluated later.
  Magnitudes are not report-grade.

### T4.3 — Baseline freeze + report skeleton (draft-early) — M
Full N-trial protocol on the dedicated host (SETUP.md), safe and fast
configs; CSVs (or their regeneration recipe + summary) committed;
baseline SHA recorded in D-0055. The dedicated host produces the freeze;
the cloud build VM cannot. `report/` skeleton written: all section headers, the
phase-decomposition exhibit generated from real CSV, the safe−fast
per-phase delta as the first price-of-paranoia line, threats-to-validity
seeded, and a **"numbers that must be regenerated" appendix stub seeded
from audit findings 16–23** — the kill-list exists before any prose does.

- **Acceptance:** skeleton committed; every number in it regenerated by
  the harness; baseline SHA recorded; the appendix lists each inherited
  number with its disposition (regenerate / historical-only / structural).
  **Landed T4.3:** measured kernel `35861f3`; tag `baseline-t4.3`
  (CSV freeze commit); `report/draft.md` plus generated exhibits.

### T4.3b — Audit cleanup — S
Findings 33–35, 37–39, and 36's remainder beyond the T4.0b const asserts:
delete the write-only `SWITCH_12`/`SWITCH_21`; make the kernel FIN-flag
test use the named `SEND_FIN`; remove `app::abort()` or reference it;
drop the redundant `ERR_INVALID_PARAM` allow; fix D-0040's
trap-path wording and the `stress` `heap_bytes` label; decide the
`csr.rs` module-wide allow (scoped cfg or keep with a comment).
Sequenced **after** the baseline freeze so the tree does not churn before
the before is captured; none of these affect measurement.

- **Acceptance:** zero warnings on all builds; full gate list green;
  N-trial spot-check shows no phase moved beyond noise.

### T4.4 — Rung 1: `frame_init` bump / lazy free-list — M
T4.3 freeze: `frame_init` 7.20 ms (34% of E2→E3g). The bump-pointer /
lazy free-list candidate (finding 10) is first. It **subsumes** D-0060:
`free_count()` is a walk of the ~31k-node list the bump stops building;
the co-edit is rewriting `free_count()` to bump arithmetic (walking
`HEAD` after the change would count recycled frames only and is wrong).
Design is D-0065 (amends D-0019; freeze unchanged, D-0036).
**Landed T4.4** on the dedicated host: batches `20260817T052349Z-1` /
`-2`, git_sha `83ca9f99`, stability PASS both configs. Fast E2→E3g
21.42 → 9.17 ms (−57%), beating the ~9.5 ms projection. Leftover
bounds missed (`frame_init` 141 µs, `accounting` 25 µs, safe freeze
100 µs) while every ≥ 1 ms falsification line held. D-0060 recorded
declined-by-subsumption.

- **Acceptance:** gates green; N-trial rerun shows `frame_init` and
  `accounting` both collapsed (and safe `freeze` no longer walks);
  ladder row filled; D-0060 recorded declined-by-subsumption.

### T4.5 — O(1) frame accounting — declined-by-subsumption
D-0060 as a separate rung (allocated counter on the current intrusive
list) is not landed. T4.4's representation change is the accounting
fix. Do not start this task.

- **Acceptance:** ladder row disposition `declined-by-subsumption`.

### T4.6 — Superpages, then residue — M per rung
Only rungs whose *attributed* projected gain ≥ 5% of the current E2→E3g
median (D-0058). **2 MiB superpages (D-0059) measured 2026-08-17**
(batches `20260817T061753Z-1`/`-2`, git_sha `76830e13`, stability
PASS both configs). Fast E2→E3g 9.17 → 6.43 ms (−30%), in the
5.5–8.0 ms range. Cumulative from freeze 21.42 → 6.43 ms (3.3×).
`page_verify` 731 µs (grain-correct; not the 1.5–2.2 ms 4K-stepping
band). `tables_used` = 5. Both paging phases overran their ranges
(D-0069). `freeze` 7.3 → 12.2 µs is a named TCG secondary, not a
co-edit miss.
**Profile after T4.6:** no phase exceeds 19%; seven clear the 5%
bar (322 µs). Only `virtq_init` (842 µs = 13%) is a real remaining
E2→E3g *candidate* (discarded first pass). The other six are the
HTTP byte, D-0043 paranoia, necessary task slots, the live NIC
pass, leftover page_build, and ARP wait. Ladder is **not** closed
(one candidate still clears). D-0068 dump placement landed and was
measured: two invocations, E3w→E4 untouched, occupancy hypothesis
not confirmed, yield kept. Next *action* is the Linux baseline.
E0→E4 is 51.66 ms on the T4.6 batches; virtq_init is ~0.8 ms of
that (1.6%). The former ~31 ms "E3w→E4" of that 52 ms is resolved
(D-0070/D-0071): QEMU startup + guest boot wait + sub-ms delivery,
each already counted once in E0→E4 — no separate host term exists.
Do not take virtq_init next.
**`virtq_init` (finding 4):** remains eligible at 13% of 6.43 ms;
**not** bundled with `DRIVER_OK`. Ceiling on the gain: skip the
discarded pass, keep `fill_descriptors`.
Other residue, still data-driven: gate `ping_gateway` behind
`not(fast-boot)`; tick arming under fast-boot (legal only after
T4.0b(c)); E3g-tail only if `syn_rx`→`E3g` shows removable kernel
time. Each rung: hypothesis → expected gain → land with its
co-edit list → full gates → N-trial → ladder row → one commit.

- **Acceptance:** every candidate landed-with-row or declined-with-reason;
  the ladder closes when no remaining candidate clears the 5% bar (the
  diminishing-returns floor declaration, cited in the report).

### T4.7 — `-bios none`: firmware cost measured by removal — L
Scoped amendment to D-0003 (D-0061): a measurement variant, not a platform
change; `-bios default` remains the default everywhere. A pure-boot
M-mode shim linked at 0x8000_0000 in the same ELF (kernel keeps its
0x8020_0000 link address and S-mode identity): PMP catch-all, full
delegation, `mcounteren.TM`, `menvcfg.STCE` (Sstc), `mret` to `_start`.
No resident M-mode services: timer becomes `stimecmp` at D-0018's
one-site seam; console becomes a polled NS16550A write (D-0004 revisited
for this variant only); shutdown becomes the sifive_test store (D-0017's
toolbox); UART + sifive_test pages mapped at build (D-0039 pattern).
`mtvec` parks with a diagnostic: any M-mode trap after boot is a bug.
Allowlisted S-kernel seams: entry, timer-arm site, console backend,
shutdown backend, two page mappings. Variant harness touchpoints per
audit finding 29. **Abandon criteria (returns-based, not calendar):**
stop and write up the partial result if (a) the variant demands S-kernel
changes beyond the allowlist, (b) the first working boot shows E0→E4
savings under 2× the largest remaining S-mode rung, or (c) M-mode
debugging exceeds what the DEBUGGING.md channels can name.

- **Acceptance:** `just test-m` lane (boot, net, HTTP, fast-release
  subset) green on the variant; N-trial rows; the firmware-cost exhibit
  filled with the `-bios default` rows unchanged as primary.

### T4.8 — Linux baseline — L
Buildroot at a pinned release (D-0062): `qemu_riscv64_virt_defconfig`
base; kernel trimmed toward tinyconfig keeping serial console,
virtio-mmio/net, IPv4 TCP, initramfs, devtmpfs, ELF binfmt; modules,
IPv6, block, and the rest off — each delta in a committed defconfig
fragment. Two Linux rows: trimmed (primary, the good-faith floor attempt)
and stock defconfig (reference showing what tuning bought). Initramfs is
a hand-rolled cpio: `/init` *is* the server — static C, no busybox, no
shell: socket → bind :80 → listen → `READY` marker → accept loop →
single read → write the byte-identical 92-byte response → close.
Cmdline primary `console=ttyS0 quiet loglevel=0 rdinit=/init`; secondary
instrumented config (`loglevel=7`, `CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME`,
`initcall_debug`). Comparisons ride only on client-observed edges;
Linux's decomposition comes from the instrumented run and is presented
with the asymmetry stated (different instrument, measured on the logging
config, quiet-vs-instrumented delta shown). Same QEMU binary, machine,
single CPU, default 128 MiB, same netdev/hostfwd/filter-dump.
E3w→E4 dump placement (D-0068) landed and was measured: the dump
is off the publish→E4 path on principle and did not take the ~31 ms
term. D-0070 (confirmed) explained why: the term was the accepted
connection waiting for the guest plus QEMU's own startup slice
(D-0071), not host work; true delivery is `D_fin` at 63–155 µs.
Cross-system tables carry no E3w-derived columns, E0→E4 is the
comparison (two direct client-clock stamps, unconfounded by boot
length), and E0→first-connect is a same-QEMU control.

- **Acceptance:** `just bench-linux` produces both configs' rows through
  the same harness; pcap shows the same handshake/response shape; the
  build regenerates from a committed script + pinned tarball hash.

### T4.8b — Act on the FTRACE miss — S
D-0073. Same five-arm campaign as T4.8 (`just bench-t48`) on a new
`Image-trimmed` with `# CONFIG_FTRACE is not set` plus the T4.8
printk leftovers. T4.8 pins stay the before; the before/after is
the finding. PLAN T4.9 remains the Unikraft spike.

- **Acceptance:** `just linux-build` on the bench host produces a
  new `Image-trimmed` (hash ≠ T4.8) and an unchanged `Image-stock`;
  `just bench-t48` records T4.8b; exhibit pins `ffb7ac7` /
  `d705ecb` / `93ab617` are not retargeted.

### T4.9 — Unikraft spike — M
Pin the PR #1698 branch commit and kraftkit version (D-0063). **Go** =
the HTTP example builds for qemu/riscv64 at the pin, boots on our pinned
QEMU with documented flag deltas, and answers the harness client.
**No-go** = build failure surviving config-level fixes; riscv64 network
path nonfunctional; or any fix requiring patches to Unikraft internals —
then we would be benchmarking our fork, so the spike ends there (that
line is both the go/no-go and the abandon criterion). Fallbacks per
D-0043, in report terms: (1) three-way on client edges + their native
boot instrumentation as a labeled exhibit; (2) different-ISA reference in
a separate exhibit, never sharing a table with riscv64 numbers, plus a
source-level riscv64 boot-path analysis; (3) two-way quantitative +
qualitative Unikraft section, stated in the abstract. If their build
requires a different QEMU version, a Whimbrel control row runs under that
QEMU to bound the version effect. Sequenced right after T4.3 so the
comparison section's shape settles while the draft is young.
**Concluded T4.9 (no-go at the pin; D-0063).** Pin recorded
2026-08-22: PR #1698 head `e9b1d549`, kraftkit prerelease
`v0.12.15-11-g5019204e`, catalog `c-http` `7196610a`. Go criteria
not met by source analysis at the pin — the riscv64 network path is
nonfunctional (the PLIC driver registers no `fdt_xlat`; the platform
bus asserts on it while probing the `virtio,mmio` transports QEMU
`virt` always presents; crash before `main`) and the fix is new
driver code, which the no-core-patches line forbids; the abandon
line held, no patch written. Fallback (3) selected 2026-08-23. The
Results section "Unikraft: boot-path analysis at the pin" was
written 2026-08-24 — acceptance met in its qualitative-analysis
form.

- **Acceptance:** go/no-go recorded with evidence; the corresponding
  report section exists in the draft with numbers or the qualitative
  analysis.

### T4.10 — Secondary metrics — M
Syscall latency: Whimbrel `gettime`-bracketed hot loop (100k iterations)
of `gettime`; Linux both ways — forced trap path
(`syscall(SYS_clock_gettime)`) *and* vDSO, the latter approximating what
a single-privilege unikernel gets (the comparison D-0010 promised).
Memory: image bytes, guest-reported free (frames free vs. MemFree), QEMU
max RSS — with D-0030's reservation-vs-working-set caveat stated, and
finding 11 (the idle heap) noted. All through the same harness and CSV
shape.

- **Acceptance:** exhibit filled from N-trial data on both systems.

### T4.11 — Report to final — L
Content-complete draft (all exhibits, all sections, claims discipline per
D-0064) → **second audit** → revision → final. **The second audit is a named step, not a vibe:** same
findings-only format as `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`, scoped to what changed
since it — the superpage walker and verifier as landed, the harness
as-built, the `-bios none` shim if it landed, and every number in the
report checked against the CSVs that claim to generate it. Findings
recorded as `docs/AUDIT-<date>.md`; blockers fixed before revision.

- **Acceptance:** second-audit findings file exists with dispositions;
  every number regenerated by `just bench` on a clean machine per
  SETUP.md; report reviewed and finalized with sign-off.

### T4.12 — Wrap — S
GLOSSARY (superpage, Sstc, PMP, buildroot, initramfs, vDSO, median/IQR,
TCG, warm-up discard, …) and DECISIONS catch-up; the convergence-gate
checklist walked and checked.

## Milestone acceptance test

`just bench` runs end-to-end on a clean machine following SETUP.md,
regenerates `results/*.csv` and every number cited in the report, and the
convergence gate below is fully checked.

**Convergence gate (what "done" means for M4):**
1. Harness stable per the numeric criterion; all report numbers
   regenerated by it under the pinned QEMU.
2. Ladder closed: every rung landed-with-row or declined-with-reason; no
   remaining candidate clears the 5% bar.
3. `-bios none` investigation concluded: landed with its exhibit, or
   abandoned by its recorded criteria with the partial result written up.
4. The comparison section exists in whichever D-0043 fallback shape the
   spike selected.
5. Threats-to-validity each mitigated-and-measured or plainly stated.
6. Second audit done with blockers closed;
   GLOSSARY/DECISIONS current.
7. Report finalized with sign-off.

## Risks and likely failure modes

- **Harness gold-plating.** The stability criterion is T4.1's finish
  line, not "perfect"; if it cannot be met, investigating why is
  methodology work with a finding at the end, not an excuse to lower it.
- **TCG variance swamps sub-ms rungs.** The 5% bar and min-alongside-
  median exist for this; audit finding 12's prediction was the first
  test and was overtaken by D-0056.3 before T4.2 measured.
- **Superpage silent-wrong.** The D-0026 failure mode is made a panic by
  the level-aware verifier; the D-0059 co-edit checklist prevents the
  mystery-gate-failure version.
- **`-bios none` PMP/delegation footguns produce silent boots.** The shim
  is the one place M-mode state is programmed; DEBUGGING.md gains an
  M-mode section with the first-response ladder.
- **Buildroot host-side build time.** Pinned, scripted, cached; the
  kernel config is committed so rebuilds are mechanical.
- **Unikraft PR drift.** Pinned commit; the no-core-patches line caps the
  spike structurally.
- **Report scope creep.** Claims discipline (D-0064) plus the convergence
  gate; "fastest" never appears without its conditions clause in the same
  sentence.
