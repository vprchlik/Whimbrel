# Whimbrel

A minimal RISC-V (rv64gc) unikernel written from scratch in Rust: QEMU's
`virt` machine, OpenSBI (or the project's own M-mode shim), Sv39 paging,
single hart, single address space, one application compiled into the
image and run in U-mode over a seven-syscall interface (`write`, `exit`,
`sbrk`, `gettime`, `yield`, `recv`, `send`). At boot it brings up a hand-rolled
virtio-net driver and network stack (Ethernet, ARP, IPv4, ICMP, UDP,
TCP; smoltcp deliberately rejected) and serves one pinned HTTP
response.

The project's claims live in its measurement work: campaigns are
pre-registered with falsifiers before they run, gates fail closed, and
every published number regenerates from pinned git objects.

**Status:** M0-M3 (boot, traps, paging, U-mode execution, virtio-net,
HTTP) are done and merged. M4 (evaluation) is in progress, and it is
one milestone carrying both the measurement apparatus (harness,
campaigns, generated exhibits) and kernel changes of its own: the
phase-stamp instrumentation, the T4.7 M-mode shim with its allowlisted
kernel seams, and the `check_dtb` boot assert. The campaigns below are
measured and pinned; the technical report lands last. Remaining M4 work
is tracked in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).

## Results

All numbers are medians on **RISC-V under QEMU TCG software emulation
(no KVM)** on one pinned bench host (AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, QEMU 10.2.1;
[machine-spec](report/exhibits/machine-spec.md)), n=60 recorded per arm,
warmup excluded. Absolute times here are not comparable to published
x86+KVM figures, which run roughly 5-10× lower; the ratio is what
transfers, because the emulation penalty applies to both arms
([cross-system](report/exhibits/cross-system.md)).

Boot to first HTTP byte (E0→E4, QEMU process spawn to first response
byte at the client) from one campaign with all arms interleaved
([cross-system-t48c](report/exhibits/cross-system-t48c.md)):

| system | E0→E4 median | IQR |
|---|---:|---:|
| Whimbrel `release-fast-boot` | **51.95 ms** | 258.3 µs |
| Whimbrel `release-default` (boot-time verification on) | 139.34 ms | 631.6 µs |
| Linux, minimal, tuned in good faith (Buildroot 2026.02.3 / kernel 6.18.7, config published) | 263.75 ms | 1.43 ms |
| Linux, stock defconfig | 923.70 ms | 3.33 ms |

Under those conditions (QEMU TCG software emulation on RISC-V, no KVM,
same host and same QEMU for every arm), the trimmed Linux baseline takes
**5.1×** the unikernel's time to first HTTP byte and stock takes
**17.8×**, and the comparison carries a known measured bias toward
Whimbrel: the D-0075 `/init` neighbor-table round trip adds 2.87 ms to
every Linux row, published in the exhibit. Beside that, a second
disclosed Linux-side component is image-size scaling of the pre-guest
slice S: roughly **6–13 ms (trimmed)** and **10–20 ms (stock)** of
E0→E4 that Whimbrel does not pay (D-0082; a bracket — two read-only
methods agreed on direction and not on precision; not regenerable
from the pinned CSVs). Charging a small image is a real unikernel
property; this does not retract the ratio. This is largely a result of
the single-purpose structure.

Two more measured results:

- **Firmware removal**
  ([t47-firmware](report/exhibits/t47-firmware.md)). Under the same
  QEMU TCG conditions, replacing OpenSBI with the project's 320-byte
  M-mode boot shim in the `-bios` slot cuts fast-boot E0→E4 from
  52.27 / 52.19 ms to 28.58 / 28.50 ms per batch (−23.69 ms, 1.8×), of
  which only −0.714 ms is guest-side work; the rest is the removed
  firmware window, a volatile quantity reported per batch and never
  pooled. This is its own campaign: per the repo's same-campaign rule
  its ratio is computed only against its own OpenSBI arm, never against
  the table above.
- **Guest kernel work** ([edges](report/exhibits/edges.md),
  [phase-decomposition](report/exhibits/phase-decomposition.md)).
  E2→E3g (first kernel instruction to the HTTP response published)
  went from 21.42 ms at the pre-optimization freeze to 6.43 ms after a
  ladder of pre-registered optimization rungs. Every phase in that
  interval is attributed; none exceeds 19% of the total.

**What this is not.** As an operating system, Whimbrel is not
very significant. It runs one workload on one emulated machine
shape, serves one request, then exits. The major artifact is the
measurement discipline. The decision log keeps the misses next to
the wins: a headline metric retired when analysis showed its name
promised something it did not measure, an aborted campaign, a
diagnosis refuted by data already on disk, an expectation model
retired after three consecutive misses in the same direction.

## What's in the repo

| path | what it is |
|---|---|
| `src/` | the kernel: boot, trap handling, Sv39 paging, scheduler, virtio-net driver, the network stack |
| `app/` | the single U-mode application (the HTTP responder), linked into the kernel image |
| `usys/` | the seven syscall stubs |
| `linker.ld` | image layout, including the dedicated user sections `check-utext` enforces |
| `scripts/` | the harness: boot gates, pcap assertions, `bench.py`, the exhibit generator |
| `bench/linux/` | pinned inputs for the Linux baseline: Buildroot pin, kernel-config fragments, `/init` |
| `docs/` | `PLAN.md` (milestones, acceptance tests), `DECISIONS.md` (the 80-entry decision log), `DEBUGGING.md` (rv64/QEMU field guide), `GLOSSARY.md`, `SETUP.md` |
| `report/` | generated exhibits (`report/exhibits/`); the technical report itself is still in draft |
| `results/` | latest-run CSVs, overwritten per run; report data lives only in pinned git objects (see [results/README.md](results/README.md)) |
| `justfile` | every gate and campaign as a recipe |

## Build and run

Environment ([docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)): `qemu-system-riscv64`,
`just`, `tshark` (the gates assert on packet captures), and the Rust
toolchain pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```bash
just build     # cross-compile the kernel
just test      # headless gate: boot markers, curl the HTTP demo, pcap assertions
just run       # boot the one-shot image: serve one GET, then exit
just run-http  # persist the image on host :8080 …
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8080/   # … and fetch it from another terminal
```

`just --list` shows the rest: per-gate recipes (`test-panic`,
`test-net-tcp`, `check-utext`, …), `just debug` / `just gdb` for the
GDB stub, and `just report-exhibits`, which regenerates every report
table from pinned git objects. The measurement campaigns
(`just bench-*`) fail closed anywhere but the dedicated bench host:
bare metal, performance governor, SMT off, boost off, zero steal
(D-0055).
